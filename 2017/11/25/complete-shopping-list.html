SK, p. 152&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Items that do not occupy body slots&lt;/div&gt;As we all know, there are 12 slots that the body can use to benefit form magic items (Head, Face, Throat, Torso, Body, Waist, Shoulders, Arms, Hands, Feet and Two Rings).Some items don’t occupy these classic body slots, meaning they can be benefited from even if you have occupied all of your slots. Some other items can be attached to other items. Other “items” can be implanted as part of your body, giving you some sort of benefit without occupying a body slot. So,in other words, there are many ways to “cheat” the body slot limitations:&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Grafts&lt;/div&gt;To simply define them grafts are body parts that are implanted into your physical body. Usually extracted from a donor, a creature of an specific subtype, a Graft is implanted into your body through some sort of “surgery” that most of the time involves a sacrifice (usually you lose Hit Points). These grafts have some characteristics that need to be addressed:There are different types of grafts depending on the tpye of donor: Draconic, Yuan-ti, Undead, Aboleth, Ilithid, etc.An individual can only have grafts from ONE of these types of graftsGrafts are hard to remove, they cannot be damaged or attacked, and only a creature with the required feat can remove it with a process that lasts hours (This is a good thing, because they are safe from Sunder Attacks or any type of damage)Grafts are not considered magic items, they don’t radiate magical auras, cannot be suppresed by dispel magic neither antimagic field (This is perfect, no way they can get rid of grafts plus they work great in an Antimagic Field-based build)A graft dies when you die (This is the worst drawback, the time you die, you lose the graft, therefore the money you have spent on it, so unless you are inmune to death effects and have frenzy, or unless you have a greater contingency spell on you or some sort of ability to remain alive, Grafts can be very risky)Grafts can be found on: Races of the Dragon, Libris Mortis, Lord of Madness, Serpent Kingdoms, Faiths of Eberron and others.Ioun Stones: The so known Ioun Stones are magic items that you can get benefit from without occupying body slots, they can be found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide page 260.Psychoactive Skins: These are psionic items that cover your whole body, leaving all other items fully functional. Up to three can be worn but only one can be active at a time. These can be found on Expanded Psionic Handbook page 175, Complete Psionic page 109 and were also included in the Magic Item Compendium page 169Standards: These items in order to grant you benefits must be attached to a two-handed hafted weapon such as a lance or a halberd. These can be found in the Complete Warrior page 136.Heraldic Crests: These items are placed in any light, heavy or tower shield that has at least a +1 bonus. No more than one Heraldic Crest can be attached to a single shield. These items can be found in Heroes of Battle page 130. In order to use these you need one of the three requirements: The Leadership feat, One or more commander auras (Heroes of Battle page 75) or the permission to wear these by a lord, priest or a similar ruler (at DM’s discretion)Armor, Shield and Weapon Crystals: These gems or crystals vary in three different qualities: lesser, least and greater. Each category varies in its cost and benefit. These crystals can be attached to a single weapon, armor or shield. The lesser requires the armor, shield or weapon to be at least masterwork quality, the lesser requires them to be at least of +1 enhancement and the greater needs them to be +3. These crystals can be found in the Magic Item Compendium, pages 24 (Armor and Shield) and 64 (Weapons)Tools: As their name suggests these items can be benefited from without occupying slots, however there is a broad range of options to choose from, nearly all books have some of these sweets.&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Minor Tricks&lt;/div&gt;The Extra Rings Feat (Eberron Campaign Setting), p. 53 allows you to use four rings instead of two (Forge Ring feat required though).Multiple Different Abilities (Dungeon Master’s Guide page 282). As described in the DMG, you could have two items in one, by paying 50% more for the second item: This is also described in Dungeon Master’s Guide page 288: “Adding New Abilities” (Usually benefit from two items and the one that costs lest is the one you pay 1.5x)At DM’s discretion you could “Add a New Ability” to your existing item in the Throat: Add the ability of the “Hand of Glory” (DMG, p. 258) and you will get an additional ring slot for free." />

SK, p. 152&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Items that do not occupy body slots&lt;/div&gt;As we all know, there are 12 slots that the body can use to benefit form magic items (Head, Face, Throat, Torso, Body, Waist, Shoulders, Arms, Hands, Feet and Two Rings).Some items don’t occupy these classic body slots, meaning they can be benefited from even if you have occupied all of your slots. Some other items can be attached to other items. Other “items” can be implanted as part of your body, giving you some sort of benefit without occupying a body slot. So,in other words, there are many ways to “cheat” the body slot limitations:&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Grafts&lt;/div&gt;To simply define them grafts are body parts that are implanted into your physical body. Usually extracted from a donor, a creature of an specific subtype, a Graft is implanted into your body through some sort of “surgery” that most of the time involves a sacrifice (usually you lose Hit Points). These grafts have some characteristics that need to be addressed:There are different types of grafts depending on the tpye of donor: Draconic, Yuan-ti, Undead, Aboleth, Ilithid, etc.An individual can only have grafts from ONE of these types of graftsGrafts are hard to remove, they cannot be damaged or attacked, and only a creature with the required feat can remove it with a process that lasts hours (This is a good thing, because they are safe from Sunder Attacks or any type of damage)Grafts are not considered magic items, they don’t radiate magical auras, cannot be suppresed by dispel magic neither antimagic field (This is perfect, no way they can get rid of grafts plus they work great in an Antimagic Field-based build)A graft dies when you die (This is the worst drawback, the time you die, you lose the graft, therefore the money you have spent on it, so unless you are inmune to death effects and have frenzy, or unless you have a greater contingency spell on you or some sort of ability to remain alive, Grafts can be very risky)Grafts can be found on: Races of the Dragon, Libris Mortis, Lord of Madness, Serpent Kingdoms, Faiths of Eberron and others.Ioun Stones: The so known Ioun Stones are magic items that you can get benefit from without occupying body slots, they can be found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide page 260.Psychoactive Skins: These are psionic items that cover your whole body, leaving all other items fully functional. Up to three can be worn but only one can be active at a time. These can be found on Expanded Psionic Handbook page 175, Complete Psionic page 109 and were also included in the Magic Item Compendium page 169Standards: These items in order to grant you benefits must be attached to a two-handed hafted weapon such as a lance or a halberd. These can be found in the Complete Warrior page 136.Heraldic Crests: These items are placed in any light, heavy or tower shield that has at least a +1 bonus. No more than one Heraldic Crest can be attached to a single shield. These items can be found in Heroes of Battle page 130. In order to use these you need one of the three requirements: The Leadership feat, One or more commander auras (Heroes of Battle page 75) or the permission to wear these by a lord, priest or a similar ruler (at DM’s discretion)Armor, Shield and Weapon Crystals: These gems or crystals vary in three different qualities: lesser, least and greater. Each category varies in its cost and benefit. These crystals can be attached to a single weapon, armor or shield. The lesser requires the armor, shield or weapon to be at least masterwork quality, the lesser requires them to be at least of +1 enhancement and the greater needs them to be +3. These crystals can be found in the Magic Item Compendium, pages 24 (Armor and Shield) and 64 (Weapons)Tools: As their name suggests these items can be benefited from without occupying slots, however there is a broad range of options to choose from, nearly all books have some of these sweets.&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Minor Tricks&lt;/div&gt;The Extra Rings Feat (Eberron Campaign Setting), p. 53 allows you to use four rings instead of two (Forge Ring feat required though).Multiple Different Abilities (Dungeon Master’s Guide page 282). As described in the DMG, you could have two items in one, by paying 50% more for the second item: This is also described in Dungeon Master’s Guide page 288: “Adding New Abilities” (Usually benefit from two items and the one that costs lest is the one you pay 1.5x)At DM’s discretion you could “Add a New Ability” to your existing item in the Throat: Add the ability of the “Hand of Glory” (DMG, p. 258) and you will get an additional ring slot for free." />

{"description":"This is a thread that&#39;s has been lost to 339&#39;s forum purge and I was regularly receiving the white screen of death for it. I loved this compilation and regularly visited for the finishing touches of my characters. Fortunately, while delving deep into the wayback machine I dug this list up and now it&#39;s available once again :D This is not my work, kuddos and a very big thanks to joseccb! You can retreive the thread here. Been trying to complete a list of magical items organized by their function. I hope this is helpful to anyone and please suggest any changes or additions.Will be updated with every release and with 4th edition as well…Some items were excluded: Intelligent Items, Cursed Items, Artifacts, Unique Items, Relics and some restricted items.&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Legend&lt;/div&gt;DMG = Dungeon Master’s Guide DMG2 = Dungeon Master’s Guide IIMIC = Magic Item CompendiumLoM = Lord of MadnessLM = Libris MortisHoB = Heroes of BattleCC = Complete ChampionDraC = DraconomiconXPH = Expanded Psionic HandbookDM = Dragon MagicFrB = FrostburnCAr = Complete ArcaneCM = Complete MageCW = Complete WarriorCAd = Complete AdventurerCPs = Complete PsionicsPH = Planar HandbookRoDr = Races of the DragonSand = SandstormSoX = Secrets of Xen’DrikRoE = Races of EberronECS = Eberron Campaign SettingFaith = Faiths of EberronCoR = Champions of RuinCSW = City Splendors of WaterdeepRoF = Races of FaerunSK = Serpent KingdomsSS = Shining SouthUD = UnderdarkLEoF = Lost Empires of FaerunPGtF= Player’s Guide to FaerunToM = Tome of Magic&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Energy Resistance&lt;/div&gt;Acid Resistance, Armor Enhancement, 18,000-66,000gp.

SK, p. 152&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Items that do not occupy body slots&lt;/div&gt;As we all know, there are 12 slots that the body can use to benefit form magic items (Head, Face, Throat, Torso, Body, Waist, Shoulders, Arms, Hands, Feet and Two Rings).Some items don’t occupy these classic body slots, meaning they can be benefited from even if you have occupied all of your slots. Some other items can be attached to other items. Other “items” can be implanted as part of your body, giving you some sort of benefit without occupying a body slot. So,in other words, there are many ways to “cheat” the body slot limitations:&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Grafts&lt;/div&gt;To simply define them grafts are body parts that are implanted into your physical body. Usually extracted from a donor, a creature of an specific subtype, a Graft is implanted into your body through some sort of “surgery” that most of the time involves a sacrifice (usually you lose Hit Points). These grafts have some characteristics that need to be addressed:There are different types of grafts depending on the tpye of donor: Draconic, Yuan-ti, Undead, Aboleth, Ilithid, etc.An individual can only have grafts from ONE of these types of graftsGrafts are hard to remove, they cannot be damaged or attacked, and only a creature with the required feat can remove it with a process that lasts hours (This is a good thing, because they are safe from Sunder Attacks or any type of damage)Grafts are not considered magic items, they don’t radiate magical auras, cannot be suppresed by dispel magic neither antimagic field (This is perfect, no way they can get rid of grafts plus they work great in an Antimagic Field-based build)A graft dies when you die (This is the worst drawback, the time you die, you lose the graft, therefore the money you have spent on it, so unless you are inmune to death effects and have frenzy, or unless you have a greater contingency spell on you or some sort of ability to remain alive, Grafts can be very risky)Grafts can be found on: Races of the Dragon, Libris Mortis, Lord of Madness, Serpent Kingdoms, Faiths of Eberron and others.Ioun Stones: The so known Ioun Stones are magic items that you can get benefit from without occupying body slots, they can be found in the Dungeon Master’s Guide page 260.Psychoactive Skins: These are psionic items that cover your whole body, leaving all other items fully functional. Up to three can be worn but only one can be active at a time. These can be found on Expanded Psionic Handbook page 175, Complete Psionic page 109 and were also included in the Magic Item Compendium page 169Standards: These items in order to grant you benefits must be attached to a two-handed hafted weapon such as a lance or a halberd. These can be found in the Complete Warrior page 136.Heraldic Crests: These items are placed in any light, heavy or tower shield that has at least a +1 bonus. No more than one Heraldic Crest can be attached to a single shield. These items can be found in Heroes of Battle page 130. In order to use these you need one of the three requirements: The Leadership feat, One or more commander auras (Heroes of Battle page 75) or the permission to wear these by a lord, priest or a similar ruler (at DM’s discretion)Armor, Shield and Weapon Crystals: These gems or crystals vary in three different qualities: lesser, least and greater. Each category varies in its cost and benefit. These crystals can be attached to a single weapon, armor or shield. The lesser requires the armor, shield or weapon to be at least masterwork quality, the lesser requires them to be at least of +1 enhancement and the greater needs them to be +3. These crystals can be found in the Magic Item Compendium, pages 24 (Armor and Shield) and 64 (Weapons)Tools: As their name suggests these items can be benefited from without occupying slots, however there is a broad range of options to choose from, nearly all books have some of these sweets.&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Minor Tricks&lt;/div&gt;The Extra Rings Feat (Eberron Campaign Setting), p. 53 allows you to use four rings instead of two (Forge Ring feat required though).Multiple Different Abilities (Dungeon Master’s Guide page 282). As described in the DMG, you could have two items in one, by paying 50% more for the second item: This is also described in Dungeon Master’s Guide page 288: “Adding New Abilities” (Usually benefit from two items and the one that costs lest is the one you pay 1.5x)At DM’s discretion you could “Add a New Ability” to your existing item in the Throat: Add the ability of the “Hand of Glory” (DMG, p. 258) and you will get an additional ring slot for free.","@type":"BlogPosting","headline":"The Complete Shopping List","dateModified":"2017-11-25T14:33:00+02:00","datePublished":"2017-11-25T14:33:00+02:00","url":"https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/complete-shopping-list.html","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/complete-shopping-list.html"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dictum Mortuum"},"@context":"http://schema.org"}</script>

Some other items can be attached to other items. Other "items" can be implanted as part of your body, giving you some sort of benefit without occupying a body slot. So,in other words, there are many ways to "cheat" the body slot limitations:<br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: small;">Grafts</span></b></div><br />To simply define them grafts are body parts that are implanted into your physical body. Usually extracted from a donor, a creature of an specific subtype, a Graft is implanted into your body through some sort of "surgery" that most of the time involves a sacrifice (usually you lose Hit Points). These grafts have some characteristics that need to be addressed:<br />There are different types of grafts depending on the tpye of donor: Draconic, Yuan-ti, Undead, Aboleth, Ilithid, etc.<br />An individual can only have grafts from ONE of these types of grafts<br />Grafts are hard to remove, they cannot be damaged or attacked, and only a creature with the required feat can remove it with a process that lasts hours (This is a good thing, because they are safe from Sunder Attacks or any type of damage)<br />Grafts are not considered magic items, they don't radiate magical auras, cannot be suppresed by dispel magic neither antimagic field (This is perfect, no way they can get rid of grafts plus they work great in an Antimagic Field-based build)<br />A graft dies when you die (This is the worst drawback, the time you die, you lose the graft, therefore the money you have spent on it, so unless you are inmune to death effects and have frenzy, or unless you have a greater contingency spell on you or some sort of ability to remain alive, Grafts can be very risky)<br />Grafts can be found on: Races of the Dragon, Libris Mortis, Lord of Madness, Serpent Kingdoms, Faiths of Eberron and others.<br /><br /><b>Ioun Stones:</b> The so known Ioun Stones are magic items that you can get benefit from without occupying body slots, they can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide page 260.<br /><br /><b>Psychoactive Skins: </b>These are psionic items that cover your whole body, leaving all other items fully functional. Up to three can be worn but only one can be active at a time. These can be found on Expanded Psionic Handbook page 175, Complete Psionic page 109 and were also included in the Magic Item Compendium page 169<br /><br /><b>Standards: </b>These items in order to grant you benefits must be attached to a two-handed hafted weapon such as a lance or a halberd. These can be found in the Complete Warrior page 136.<br /><br /><b>Heraldic Crests:</b> These items are placed in any light, heavy or tower shield that has at least a +1 bonus. No more than one Heraldic Crest can be attached to a single shield. These items can be found in Heroes of Battle page 130. In order to use these you need one of the three requirements: The Leadership feat, One or more commander auras (Heroes of Battle page 75) or the permission to wear these by a lord, priest or a similar ruler (at DM's discretion)<br /><br /><b>Armor, Shield and Weapon Crystals:</b> These gems or crystals vary in three different qualities: lesser, least and greater. Each category varies in its cost and benefit. These crystals can be attached to a single weapon, armor or shield. The lesser requires the armor, shield or weapon to be at least masterwork quality, the lesser requires them to be at least of +1 enhancement and the greater needs them to be +3. These crystals can be found in the Magic Item Compendium, pages 24 (Armor and Shield) and 64 (Weapons)<br /><br /><b>Tools:</b> As their name suggests these items can be benefited from without occupying slots, however there is a broad range of options to choose from, nearly all books have some of these sweets.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Minor Tricks</span></b><b><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b></div><br />The Extra Rings Feat (Eberron Campaign Setting), p. 53 allows you to use four rings instead of two (Forge Ring feat required though).<br />Multiple Different Abilities (Dungeon Master's Guide page 282). As described in the DMG, you could have two items in one, by paying 50% more for the second item: This is also described in Dungeon Master's Guide page 288: "Adding New Abilities" (Usually benefit from two items and the one that costs lest is the one you pay 1.5x)<br />At DM's discretion you could "Add a New Ability" to your existing item in the Throat: Add the ability of the "Hand of Glory" (DMG, p. 258) and you will get an additional ring slot for free.
