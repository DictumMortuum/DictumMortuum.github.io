Most of the build is still rudamentary, and I’d love to find feats to make it more efficient.In all times, in all places, children have their stories of the dark figure who lurks in the shadows, ready to pounce on the unwary and drag them off. He goes by many names in many cultures, but is known to some simply as the Boogeyman. Parents, of course, always dismiss such stories with the same strengthless reassurances–there’s no such thing as a Boogeyman, he’s not hiding in the closet, and he’s not going to eat you. The children know differently, though.And in the city of Sharn, the children are right. There IS a Boogeyman, and he IS coming to eat your soul.Nobody knows for sure who this creature is, or how he came to be…but he is undeniably more than childrens’ stories. The dregs of the city speak of him in hushed whispers, and there are certain areas of the sewers and the low city which they avoid like the plague. These are the haunts of the Boogeyman, and those who go in do not come out again. He has worn a thousand faces, and will wear a thousand more–usually the faces of those most trusted by his victim. He lives not for the kill, but for the terror in the eyes of his chosen prey. The fear is what adds savor to his meat…and his meat is nothing less than the souls of living beings. The innocent and the wicked alike are his prey, and all who know of him fear him. The Boogeyman is real.
