<h1>Why Paladin?</h1> 
 
 <p>If someone asked me to bet on the class from Player's Handbook that most people would either love or hate, my money would be on the Paladin class. Most people have different feelings about it, but one thing is for sure: they are strong ones. Usually selected by new players, thinking that they will be able to play their dream-knight in shinning armor able to slay dragons, unfortunately they are usually left with a bitter disappointment. From a character optimization view, the class lacks potential. This guide is for those that want desperately to play a Paladin for their fluff, but also need a combat edge for their knightly adventures.</p>
 <p>In this guide i will try to explore the paladins and provide as many information as possible on them. Note that i will not focus only on the player's handbook class only, but also on the variant paladins as well. As such, don't be surprised if some feats/classes/abilities that can be only obtained by non good or evil characters are suggested.</p>
 
 <div id="page-wrap">
 <div class="info-col">
 
 <h1>Attributes</h1>
 
 <p>Paladins usually act as the leader of a group and are able to cover the social role, with skills like diplomacy. They are able to minor buff party members with auras and other abilities and also receive some amount of damage. Paladins are usually melee characters, but as described above, they can assume additional secondary roles which makes them suffer from Multiple Attribute Dependence (MAD).</p>
 
 <dl>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Strength</dt> 
 <dd>Paladins are usually melee characters. While this is not your first priority, a decent score (~14) will make you able to dish out some respectable damage, especially in the early levels. Remember to place at least a score of 13, so that you can at least acquire the Power Attack feat early on in your carrer. Later, with a stat boosting item you will be able to push this attribute to a higher comfort level.</dd> 
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Dexterity</dt> 
 <dd>If you choose this you must wear lighter armor and probably use ranged weapons. Aside from a few occasions, this is considered a dump stat, as you will most probably want to create the knightly image and use plate armor, which hinders your dexterity modifier.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Constitution</dt> 
 <dd>This is important to a paladin as to any other character. Due to your role in combat, you are definitely going to have to survive large amounts of punishment. Fortunately the paladin class has good fortitude saves and comes with a modest built-in healing special ability (lay on hands), but this is not an excuse to invest lower than 14 in this attribute.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Intelligence</dt> 
 <dd>This is a dump stat to paladins due to the fact that you, well, won't be able to dump other stats. Due to their low skill points per level, paladins can't load up on many skills. Also it doesn't have other uses, except from the (powerful!) Faerunian feat Sword of Arcane Order from Champions of Valor. However, this also means that you will be unable to take feats such as combat expertise, improved trip, etc. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as those abilities rarely tend to have synergy with the paladin class, but it does cut some options.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Wisdom</dt> 
 <dd>This is your casting stat, as well the key ability for many of your skills. You can't dump this. Actually, even though this is your main casting statistic, it is debatable whether you actually need it to be high; this is because if you choose to multiclass out of the class, you will lose access to spells, too. Of course the other class might have wisdom-based spellcasting (as most paladin-based prestige classes have), so by all means I do not suggest that you dump wisdom, but just to add another consideration when planning your build. Even if you choose to stay as a paladin, you will not need higher than 12 wisdom for the first 8+ levels, assuming you don't care for spell DC and/or bonus spells. Finally, it is true that it boosts some of your skills (profession, sense motive and heal), but aside from sense motive you either don't have to boost them to warrant high attribute modifier or you don't really need them.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Charisma</dt> 
 <dd>This is important for you for various abilities: turn undead, saves, smite. Also most paladin prestige classes use charisma for various class features. Most classes have a statistic that would like to raise to extremes, due to the fact that it boosts their class features and it synergizes with most of their feat and equipment options; for the paladin class, this statistic is charisma. It will give you more turn attempts, more attack power combined with smite, higher saves and empower many of the class abilities you will pick along the way. Note that even though charisma is so good and synergistic for the paladin class, don't over-do it, especially when using the point-buy system, as that will leave you exposed. You can milk some points from wisdom, dexterity and intelligence to safely get a 16 in charisma, but going higher without the benefits that spellcasters have is probably not worth it.</dd>
 </div> 
 
 </dl>
 
 <p>Bottom line: Assuming you're in a 28 point buy game, a spread of 14/10/14/10/14/14 is gonna serve you fine. In case your stats are worse, you're better off lowering your wisdom to a minimum of 10-11 (you're not going to cast anything until level 4, so you can pump it with stat points later), your dexterity to a minimum of 8, or even your intelligence (if you choose to completely neglect skills - remember that you're always going to receive one skill point per level, no matter what). Elite array is probably best placed as: 13/8/14/10/12/15.</p>
 
 <h1>Races</h1>
 
 <dl>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Humans <div class="book">PHB</div></dt> 
 <dd>The human race offers everything a paladin needs, as a package deal, except for stat boosts. Probably the best race from the optimization scope, this offers you the bonus feat that you need, the bonus skill points without having to load on intelligence and your favored class can be any class. Additionally, the stereotypical paladin-knight is usually a human in heavy armor, so this race option gives you a lot of fluff points, too. You can also select the Silverbrow Human subrace (Dragon Magic) which loses the bonus skills, but gives you a few bonus abilities and retain the bonus feat. The biggest bonus is probably the dragonblood subtype, which increases the potential of several abilities (for instance, the feat Draconic Aura scales if you have the dragonblood subtype).</dd>
 </div> 
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Dwarfs <div class="book">PHB</div></dt>
 <dd>They get a charisma hit, but they have nice features, including keeping their natural speed in any armor and stability. A hidden bonus to the dwarf race (and most of their sub-races), is that since their speed can't be hindered, they can tumble even in heavy armor. The paladin class doesn't offer tumble as a class skill, but you can swap ride for tumble using the Cityscape web enhancement. You should seriously consider the other dwarf subraces, which do not receive a penalty to their charisma score, like Dream Dwarfs (Races of Stone) which have a penalty to dexterity instead. Another bonus that dwarfs have are the Crescent Moon Knight substitution levels, which you can access if you worship Clangeddin Silverbeard.</dd>
 </div> 
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Elves <div class="book">PHB</div></dt>
 <dd>Unless you want to grab the substitution levels, there is no reason to take them.
 Gnomes  PHB: While the Player's Handbook version isn't that suitable for a paladin, the gnome shadow cloak knight substitution levels are sweet. Actually, combined with Whisper Gnomes from Races of Stone, a stealth knight would be a viable choice, even though that gnome subrace receives a charisma penalty (you can use clever use of templates - for instance the Draconic template with level adjustment buyoff to offset the charisma loss).</dd>
 </div> 
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Half Orcs <div class="book">PHB</div><dt> 
 <dd>As above, they get some nice substitution levels. The best subrace if you want to utilize those levels is Desert Half-Orc (Unearthed Arcana), which has stat adjustments of +2 con and -2 int, it's great to get a bonus on a physical statistic that it's going to help and a penalty to a dump statistic - otherwise you're bound to lose some charisma.</dd> 
 </div> 
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Neanderthal <div class="book">FB</div></dt> 
 <dd>+2 strength and constitution -2 dexterity and intelligence. Very nice race for paladins as it gets hits in the only stats you can dump and boosts those that have a big importance in battle. If you select this race you will also receive a +2 bonus on spot, listen and survival, a racial weapon focus feat with several weapons and in addition effectivelly the Cold Endurance feat.</dd> 
 </div> 
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Hellbred <div class="book">FCII</div></dt> 
 <dd>Very nice flavor and bonuses. They get an Evil Exception so you can use evil items without taking negative levels. They also receive several bonus devil touched feats, some of which have nice charisma related uses. Alternatively you can choose the aspect that grants bonus to charisma: it may come with a hit to your constitution, but you'll eventually get telepathy and access to the feat Mindsight (Lords of Madness), which will turn you to a huge asset to your party</dd>
 </div> 
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Dragonborn of Bahamut <div class="book">RotD</div></dt>
 <dd>Bonus to constitution and hit to dexterity. You can give this "template" to any race, but you will lose most racial bonuses. Nice and versatile with its aspects. I would suggest the Heart or the Wings aspect</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Aasimar <div class="book">RoD, PGtF</div></dt> 
 <dd>Ideally this won't be necessary, but if you choose the lesser aasimar version, you can greatly reduce MAD. Also nice bonus abilities.You can also be a Dragonborn Lesser Aasimar, which pretty much offers the best attribute boni at no level adjustment -2 dex, +2 con, +2 wis, +2 cha. You can even get the afforementioned Draconic creature template (only if level adjustment buyoff is allowed!) for +2 str -2 dex +4 con +2 wis +4 cha, at +0 level adjustment after buying it off</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Killoren <div class="book">RotW</div></dt>
 <dd>Mentioned just for their flavor. They get a special smite attack several times per day</dd>
 </div>
 
 </dl>
 
 <h1>Class Features</h1>
 
 <dl>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Paladin</dt> 
 <dd>Full base attack bonus.
 Good fortitude saves.
 2+intelligence skill points.
 d10.
 Spells.
 
 These may not seem much, but there's more to this class:
 Weapon and Armor Proficiency: All simple and martial weapons, all armor and shields except tower shields. Can't get much better than this. 
 Aura of Good (Ex): Your aura strength is equal to your paladin level. While this has mild effects, you can stun evil creatures detecting you. 
 Detect Evil (Sp): Unlimited times per day, detect evil as per the spell. 
 Smite Evil (Su): This is the signature ability of the paladin. The power to deal extra damage with enhanced accuracy to evil beings. It is charisma based and deals damage based on your paladin level. As you gain levels, you gain more smite evil attempts.
 Divine Grace (Su): Gain an unnamed bonus to all your saving throws equal to your charisma modifier. Many builds dip into paladin only for this ability. 
 Lay on Hands (Su): Cure some damage on yourself or your companions or damage undead. This ability depends on charisma.
 Aura of Courage (Su): Give a large bonus to companions on fear effects. Also you are immune to fear. Remember that this is a supernatural effect and won't work inside an antimagic field or similar places. Immunity to fear effects is a very nice ability to have, however the aura effect isn't so good, although the bonus is morale.
 Divine Health (Ex): Become immune to all diseases. 
 Turn Undead (Su): At 4th level you gain turn undead. This is a very important ability and its main purpose is powering divine feats. A big problem is that since you lack the ability to turn undead prior to level 4, you won't be able to take divine feats, probably until level 6 when you get the next open feat. 
 Spells: You prepare spells and your casting is wisdom based. You are not going to use save or die spells, so a 14 wisdom score should be fine. 
 Special Mount (Sp): You gain a special mount that is stronger and tougher than normal animals of its kind. For more information see the special mount entry.
 Remove Disease (Sp): 1/week and an additional time per week for every three levels after 6th, you gain the ability to remove disease, as per the spell.
 Code of Conduct: A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin’s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.
 There are also variant paladin classes of different alignments from Unearthed Arcana:
 Paladin of Freedom:
 As standard paladin except:
 Class Skills: Replace diplomacy with bluff. 
 Aura of Resolve (Su): You are immune to compulsions and give a bonus to compulsion effects to allies close to you. Immunity to compulsions is probably better than immunity to fear, as it's probably easier to come by. 
 Spellcasting: You gain the spells: protection from law, magic circle against law, remove curse, dispel law, freedom of movement. You lose: death ward, discern lies, dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, protection from chaos. Freedom of movement is a good spell to have, but so is death ward. The other spell swaps are not that important.
 Code of Conduct: A paladin of freedom must be of chaotic good alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin of freedom's code requires that he respect individual liberty, help those in need (provided they do not use the help for lawful or evil ends), and punish those who threaten or curtail personal liberty.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Paladin of Slaughter</dt>
 <dd>As standard paladin except:
 Class Skills: Replace diplomacy with intimidate. 
 Aura of Evil (Ex): The power of your aura is equal to the paladin of slaughter level. 
 Detect Good (Sp): At will you can detect good, as per the spell. 
 Smite Good (Su): Identical to smite evil, only that works on good creatures. 
 Deadly Touch (Su): Identical to lay on hands, but it deals damage and heals undead. The main drawback is that it allows a saving throw, which isn't the case with lay on hands.
 Debilitating Aura (Su): Opponents within 10ft take a -1 penalty to armor class. This is a bad alternative to aura of courage.
 Rebuke Undead (Su): Rebuke or Turn, it doesn't matter what type of energy you are channeling when powering divine feats. 
 Cause Disease (Sp): This is bad. Not only it is subject to a saving throw, the difficulty classes for subsequent saves are all very low for high levels. 
 Spellcasting: Replace the standard paladin's spell list with the following spell list: 1st—bane, cause fear, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from good, protection from law, read magic, resistance, virtue; 2nd—bull's strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle's splendor, inflict moderate wounds, owl's wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment; 3rd—blindness/deafness, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount, prayer, inflict serious wounds, magic circle against good/law; 4th—break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel good, dispel law, inflict critical wounds, poison, unholy sword. 
 Code of Conduct: A paladin of slaughter must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of slaughter's code requires that she disrespect all authority figures who have not proven their physical superiority to her, refuse help to those in need, and sow destruction and death at all opportunities.</dd>
 </div> 
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Paladin of Tyranny</dt>
 <dd>As standard paladin except:
 Aura of Evil (Ex): The power of your aura is equal to the paladin of slaughter level. 
 Detect Good (Sp): At will you can detect good, as per the spell. 
 Smite Good (Su): Identical to smite evil, only that works on good creatures. 
 Deadly Touch (Su): Identical to lay on hands, but it deals damage and heals undead. The main drawback is that it allows a saving throw, which isn't the case with lay on hands.
 Aura of Despair (Su): This is good. A -2 penalty to all saving throws will come to play even at late game play. 
 Rebuke Undead (Su): Again you aren't going to use the main function of rebuke undead, but more for alternative uses. 
 Cause Disease (Sp): This is bad. Not only it is subject to a saving throw, the difficulty classes for subsequent saves are all very low for high levels. 
 Spellcasting: Replace the paladin's spell list with the following spell list: 1st—bane, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, doom, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from chaos, protection from good, read magic, resistance, virtue; 2nd—bull's strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle's splendor, hold person, inflict moderate wounds, owl's wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment; 3rd—bestow curse, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, discern lies, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount, prayer, inflict serious wounds, magic circle against chaos/good; 4th—break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel chaos, dispel good, dominate person, inflict critical wounds, unholy sword.
 Code of conduct: A paladin of tyranny must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of tyranny's code requires that he respect authority figures as long as they have the strength to rule over the weak, act with discipline (not engaging in random slaughter, keeping firm control over those beneath his station, and so forth), help only those who help him maintain or improve his status, and punish those who challenge authority (unless, of course, such challengers prove more worthy to hold that authority).</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Spell-less Paladin</dt>
 <dd>Appears in Complete Warrior.
 As standard paladin except:
 Spellcasting: You lose the ability to cast spells.
 Blessed Weapon: Your weapon is considered good to overcome damage reduction. Mediocre as you get that from many feats and/or weapon enhancements. Gained at 6th level.
 Divine Might: This is ok, but it isn't worth it dropping spells AND taking 11 levels in a paladin class without spells. Gained at 11th level.
 Tend to Mount: Worthless. Just cast heal mount.
 Holy Sword: Again, just memorize it.</dd>
 </div>
 
 </dl>
 
 <h1>Alternative Class Features</h1>
 
 <dl>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Charging Smite(Su) <div class="book">PHB II</div></dt>
 <dd>If along a charge attack you also smite evil, you deal an extra 2 damage per paladin level (that's 3 points per paladin bonus with the normal damage boost from smite evil). The important part is that if you miss on your charge attack, your smite ability is not considered used. If you are a single classed paladin (you shouldn't) this ability boosts your damage to ridiculous amounts versus evil opponents, up to 60 - otherwise, if you prestige out at 5th or 6th level, you're just receiving 15-18 bonus points of damage. It probably works with pounce (full attack on a charge), too. Replaces Special Mount.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Divine Spirit  <div class="book">DS</div></dt>
 <dd>You can call a spirit that helps you and your companions. It cannot be attacked except by dispel magic, banishment and dismissal as a summoned creature using your paladin level as caster level. It stays around for rounds equal to your paladin level. Replaces Special Mount.
 
 Spirit of Healing: This spirit can heal an amount of hit points equal to twice the amount you heal with your lay on hands ability. Moreover, it doesn't require an action on your part, as for someone to heal, he must end or begin his round on the spirit's square and use a standard action to activate it. 
 Spirit of Combat: +1 sacred bonus on attacks and damage per four paladin levels to all allies that are adjacent or occupy the same square as this spirit. Also weapons are treated good-aligned for overcoming damage reduction. 
 Spirit of Heroism: Great tanking spirit. You gain DR 10/-, the benefit of the diehard feat and you can use your lay on hands as a free action 1/round. 
 Spirit of the Fallen: Fast healing 10 to all adjacent allies and 1/round revive a character between 0 and -9 hit points who is inside a 30ft range. Damage healed equal twice your paladin level.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Curse Breaker(Sp) <div class="book">CM</div></dt>
 <dd>Give up remove disease and gain remove curse or remove enchantment (by giving up more uses). The good thing is that you can choose what fits better in your campaign and party , remove curse or remove disease, since you're not giving up anything else. Replaces Remove Disease.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Divine Counterspell(Sp) <div class="book">CM</div></dt>
 <dd>You are giving up your main source of divine power for the ability to hurt spellcasters (and with a penalty to your effective cleric level). This is bad. Replaces Turn Undead.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Dragonscale Husk(Ex) <div class="book">DM</div></dt>
 <dd>Gain a draconic armor that provides a scaling bonus as you go up in levels (but doesn't stack with any other bonus to AC), provides elemental resistances and allows for +2 max dexterity bonus (with an armor check penalty of -4). Not actually optimized, but it does have some bonuses as waving the cost of an actual armor. Replaces all your armor proficiencies.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Drakkensteed Mount(Sp) <div class="book">DM</div></dt>
 <dd>Drakkensteeds have a fly speed if you consider that important. They also have trample. Unfortunately it can't command others of its kind. Drakkensteeds are also dragonblood, which can benefit you if you pick certain fits for it (for instance Draconic Aura). Replaces Standard Special Mount.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Rebuke Dragons(Su) <div class="book">DM</div></dt>
 <dd>This is too campaign specific and you give up turn undead. Bad. Replaces Turn Undead.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Holy Warrior <div class="book">CC</div></dt>
 <dd>Only helpful if you are actually taking a few levels of paladin. Even then, reconsider it, as lesser restoration is a first level spell for paladins and with the 4th level you can use spell trigger items such as staffs and wands, without the need to use magic device them. Feats of note are improved smiting, mounted combat, power attack (also acquired at the level you get access to divine feats, usable to grab divine might later). However note that the Holy Warrior alternate class feature is the only way to get Divine Might at level 4, or any other divine feat, since they all have the turn undead feature as a requirement.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Underdark Knight <div class="book">CC</div></dt>
 <dd>If you are going to be in an underground campaign, this is worth it. You give up your mount and gain some abilities that depend on your level. Contrary to the name, this may be able to help in an underground campaign, but it applies in many situations. If you're pondering to give up your special mount for this, only consider it if you're willing to delve twelve levels deep into the paladin class, because that's where you receive the earth glide extraordinary ability - the ability to move through earth like a fish through water. While suffocation is not much of an issue, since you only begin suffocating after 2xconstitution (that's not constitution modifier - it's your constitution score), which is a really long time, you can use races that do not need to breathe - undead, warforged, air goblins (from unearthed arcana), to virtually stay in the ground for prelonged periods of time. Additionally, you receive either low-light or darkvision (if you already possess low-light vision), some minor skill boosts and an untyped land speed increase.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Stand Fast <div class="book">Cityscape WE</div></dt>
 <dd>As an immediate action, you can add your charisma modifier to a single saving throw to all allies between 20ft or to any roll to resist a trip, grapple, bull rush, disarm or sunder attack. Replaces Special Moun.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Skilled City Dweller <div class="book">Cityscape WE</div></dt>
 <dd>You can replace ride with tumble and handle animal for gather information. The first isn't too hot, but the second one is interesting..</dd>
 </div>
 
 </dl>
 
 <h1>Racial Substitution Levels</h1>
 
 <dl>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Dragonborn Paladin <div class="book">RotD</div></dt>
 <dd>Add knowledge (arcana) to class skills at each substitution level.
 1st level: Detect dragonblood is a lot worse than Detect Evil. You can even use detect evil to safely detect who you can smite.
 4th level: You give up turn undead for some damage boost against dragons and dragonbloods. Too specific. 
 5th level: Gain a special mount that is immune to the frightful presence of dragons. It seems that you don't lose anything, but in fact you lose a point of BAB.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Half-Orc Paladin <div class="book">RoD</div></dt>
 <dd>At each substitution level d12 hit die and intimidate replaces diplomacy.
 1st level: Righteous fury is good because it works against all enemies (since it's a self-buff) and it's a morale bonus. Moreover, the activation is free, it lasts for a number of rounds based on your charisma modifier and finally: it scales with levels. Be warned that the ability RAW suggests that you will never be able to take uses of smite evil (not even from other classes).
 3rd level: This is depends on your companions. If they use the stacking of fear effects, get this. Also aura of courage is easy to come by, so other characters may be able to provide it. Another way to take advantage of this ability is to use the feat Martial Study from the sourcebook Tome of Battle, and get intimidate as a class skill for all your paladin levels (not just the substitution ones).
 6th level: Remove disease is probably more useful than remove fatigue, mainly because the ability cooldown is huge. I used to think that, but Remove Disease has the same cooldown, and this can potentialy negate a spell like Waves of Fatigue from every member of the party. Too bad it won't affect allies that are exhausted.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Elf Paladin <div class="book">RotW</div></dt>
 <dd>At each substitution level add survival to class skills list.
 1st level: Effectively makes you able to smite evil with ranged attacks. The main drawback is that you can only smite with them. 
 3rd level: Get a +4 morale bonus to saving throws versus enchantment effects. It doesn't mention if you receive the bonus, too, or just your allies. The 3rd level ability of paladin of freedom closely resembles this (and since most enchantments out there are usually compulsions, too, that aura is a lot better, since it makes you completely immune).
 5th level: Unicorns radiate a Magic Circle against Evil, which among other things means that you and your allies within the spell's radius are completely immune to summoned creatures and mind control. That alone is already a powerful effect for 5 hours a day at so low level. However note that the unicorn will quickly lose effectiveness, since your effective paladin level for boosting its abilities receives a huge penalty.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Planar Paladin <div class="book">PlH</div></dt>
 <dd>At each substitution level add Knowledge (the planes) to your class skills list.
 4th level: Give up your turn undead to smite an evil outsider. Bad trade.
 6th level: This is a very good substitution level, probably the best if you favor a special mount. You get the celestial template on your companion for one use of Remove Disease.
 10th level: This has its uses if you travel a lot to different planes. The loss of a singe smite attempt is mild. Depends largely on the campaign.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Warforged Paladin <div class="book">RoE</div></dt> 
 <dd>Warforged Paladin levels grant the following class skills: Concentration, Craft, Knowledge(Nobility and Royalty), Knowledge(Religion), Profession and Ride.
 1st level: Smite Construct lets you use your smite evil ability against constructs, regardless of their alignment. You don't trade anything away; the only reason not to take this substitution level is the class skills that the warforged paladin levels feature: you won't have access to Diplomacy, Handle Animal or Sense Motive, for the first few levels, but your ability to use them will be restored after your 4th level.
 2nd level: Warforged characters suffer from penalties in wisdom and charisma, which are both really important for a paladin. This substitution level will help waive some of the Paladin class's MAD, by trading Divine Grace for Durable Will, an ability that will let you apply your constitution modifier on your will saves; also you're getting Repair Damage, an alternative to Lay on Hands, that's based on your constitution modifier and heals constructs and living constructs at full power, while living creatures are healed for half. This level offers you the option of completely dumping charisma in favor of a low wisdom that will let you use your spells and full-on constitution. However note that charisma often appears in many feats and features that fit the Paladin class thematically. Additionally, if you're worrying about your saves if you shun Divine Grace, check the next substitution level, which will make you immune to so many different effects, that Divine Grace will not matter that much.
 3rd level: This is a perfect level - you're trading Divine Health, an ability that's almost worthless to you, since you're already immune to disease, for immunity to stunning, an immunity that's not that easy to come by with so few levels. A Warforged Paladin using these substitution levels will have a long list of things he's immune to: poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion, effects that cause the sickened condition, energy drain, fear and stunning. Effects that can still affect the warforged paladin are: mind-affecting spells and abilities, death effects, gaze attacks, polymorph and elemental attacks.</dd>

 <dt>Berronar Valkyrie<div class="book">Champions of Valor</div></dt>
 <dd>3rd level: Your armor, shield and primary weapon become immune to acid and rust attacks and you gain resistance to acid 5. I used to think that this was a bad trade, but it comes handy when fighting against rust monsters and similar opponents that target your equipment.
 4th level: You get a conditional pounce ability, since you can activate this only if the opponent threatens a teammate and only 3+charisma times per day (which shouldn't be much of a problem). Pounce is always good and you can also combine this ability with charging smite to deal ridiculous amounts of damage versus evil enemies. Also consider the feat Battle Jump from the faerunian sourcebook Unapproachable East, as jumping on instead of charging your opponent is probably a lot easier. This remains ranked as 'black' or 'even trade', since you won't have access to divine feats without turn undead. 
 6th level: This is better than remove disease, because is "at will". I don't know what I was thinking, but unless you know what you're doing, spending an action at 6th+ level on a 0-level spell is usually a waste of time. The ability that makes an oath with an individual might be usable, but it's a lot of hustle for just making the target fatigued (although the effect lasts for days - one day for each paladin level at the time of the oath formation). The most useful application of this feature is that all parties involved instantly know that the oath was broken.</dd>

 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Claw of the Sun and Ankh <div class="book">Champions of Valor</div></dt>
 <dd>1st level: Get natural weapons some times per day. It's nice, but it's usability will diminish as you gain levels. Not only that, but the duration is limited and you need to invest a lot of levels to get it enough times per day to go through a day's encounters. Moreover, paladins lack the precision damage which is often used in conjuction with additional attacks to capitalize damage output. Additionally, the wording about smite evil suggests that you won't be able to acquire smite evil at any later levels.
 6th level: Trade Remove Disease for a smite evil progression that works on members of set's church. Unfortunately it's campaign specific.
 12th level: Trade one 3rd level slot for a source of light. Probably the worst trade ever. Not the worst trade, since it is a daylight spell and many monsters have some kind of sensitivity that daylight triggers (most common is Daylight Sensitivity), but there are easier ways of getting a source of light than going for twelve paladin levels.</dd>

 <dd>Add knowledge (local impiltur) to class skills list.
 4st level: Turn undead is strictly better than a favored enemy, especially for a nearly-worthless type like lycanthropes.
 6th level: Gain the ability to cure lycantropy or even cure lycanthropes. This is perfect, since you don't trade anything.
 10th level: Inspire courage for a 2nd level slot. The good news is that it's a scalable effect. The bad ones are that you can only use it once per day and that your effective bard level is four levels less than your paladin level, which means that you won't hit a morale bonus higher than +3.</dd>

 <dd>1st level: Ignoring damage reduction of creatures is usually very good, but this ability only affects undead foes. You also gain a small bonus to knowledge (religion) checks concerning undead, but it's a mild bonus to make a difference.
 3rd level: Most negative levels are bestowed by undead creatures and ignoring them is an important ability for any character. The loss of divine health is worth it. 
 6th level: Greater turning. This is good, because even if you have a low effective character level for turning, this is usable times/day.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Golden Cup <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>3rd level: Add any dodge AC bonus you get from Combat Expertise, fighting defensively or using the total defense to adjacent creatures. Unfortunately, RAW, you grant the dodge bonus versus your opponents, too. Unless your DM rules that only allies are affected by this, it's worthless.
 4th level: Shield Other instead of turn undead. Considering that you can actually cast Shield Other (albeit at a later level) this is very bad.
 10th level: Give up a smite attempt to gain a boost in your effective level for healing spells and lay on hands. The effect you gain is great for just one smite evil attempt, but at the level you're getting it lay on hands will probably be worthless (as well as your healing ability) and moreover you need to get a whole 10 character levels into paladin to get this ability.</dd>

 <dd>1st level: Detect magic is of equal importance to detect evil. Detect magic at will is actually an ability that's more useful in certain situations than Detect Evil; additionally, you can use it with an artificer's monocle to identify magic items some times per day.
 4th level: Too specific enemies to be more important than turn undead.
 6th level: This is better than remove disease. It is usable per day instead of per week. Indeed it is, but unless your dungeon master likes dead magic and wild magic zones, this is not going to come into play and obviously your Remove Disease (or any other alternative class feature you're able to swap that for) will come into play a lot more. On the other hand however, it's a really unique ability - I've never encountered a 'fix-the-weave' ability before, especially for the Paladin class.</dd>
 </div>

 <dt>Holy Judge <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>Add Knowledge(the Planes) to the skill list at each substitution level.
 1st level: Favored enemy (devils) instead of smite evil. It's interesting if you acquire smite evil through other means, but don't get it unless you are going to be facing devils a lot. Note that this favored enemy gets better as you get more paladin levels, but it has no effect for other favored enemies that you might have, for example, from ranger levels. 
 4th level: Not a terrible ability, but this is free. Actually, it has a saving throw DC based on your paladin levels and lasts only a single round, which is bad, but at least you can attempt to Censure Devils several times per day, at a pretty good range and it's a daze effect - not many devils will be immune to it.
 6th level: Zone of truth 1/week with the same progression as remove disease. Bad. The reasoning behind it is that Zone of Truth is a spell that allows a saving throw - not your best asset as a paladin. Moreover it's just a level 2 spell - you're getting those at level 8 (which is just 2 levels higher than level 6, when you're receiving the first use of this ability). It's better to have Remove Disease (or an alternative class feature that lets you swap it) that's an instantaneous effect with no saving throw and might come into play once or twice, than a spell that allows a saving throw.</dd>

 <dd>Add Knowledge(Nature) to the skill list at each substitution level.
 3rd level: Unfortunately the aura is usable 1/day. Its duration is ok though. I don't know what I was thinking - the duration is awful as is the damage. You're better off with an immunity than this. 
 4th level: An extra attack for turn undead. Interesting but i would pass. Again, I must have been in a hurry back when I was ranking these abilities. All features that let you get an additional attack usually let you do so at a -2 penalty on all your attacks that round; so far so good, but what makes this awful is that it has uses per day and that you're losing access to turn undead.
 5th level: Instead of animal companion get a fly speed with nice duration and cool features. You're swapping your special mount for what's essentially a 3rd level spell (Fly) with some cosmetic changes. The duration would be OK if you could break it down into several uses per day and not use it all at once, but that's not implied by the description.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Mystic Fire Knight <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>d8 hit die, add Knowledge(Arcana) and Spellcraft to the skill list at each substitution level.
 4th level: Improved spellcasting in addition to bonus spells is one of the best alternative class features that's on par with Turn Undead. You're receiving a hefty bonus to your caster level (2+caster level from another arcane spellcasting class) and bonus spells per day that will boost your paladin caster level significantly.
 5th level: This augments your smite evil without taking anything for it. Also it is a nice ability and the difficulty class is charisma based. This level doesn't take anything from your class features and adds a cool effect on your smite evil attempts, which always applies to your enemies. The duration it's just one round, but it applies to all attempts to use spells, spell completion or spell trigger items; if he fails a concentration check with a pretty good difficulty class - 10 + paladin level (note: not half your paladin levels) + charisma modifier + spell level (so even for a level 1 spell you're looking at DC 17-18+); in addition it probably applies to enemies that are not evil, although you'll have to check with your dungeon master on that.
 6th level: Targeted greater dispel magic using your paladin level as caster level times per day for weakly uses of remove disease? One of the best substitution levels. You're getting Greater Dispel Magic, which is an awesome spell that can be applied nearly to all combat situations; plus you can use it once per day than once per week; plus it doesn't require an action and you just make the decision before you roll for an attack; plus the caster level cap is at +20 and you get to add any arcane caster level you may have from another class to it. This is one of the best substitution levels and it just takes away from you Remove Disease, one of the borderline features of the class.</dd>

 <dt>Noble Heart <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>Add Survival to the skill list at each substitution level.
 3rd level: For the price of your Divine Health class feature, you get Track as a bonus feat and a hefty bonus to your survival skill for tracking followers of Loviatar. Since the Track feat requires you to hit respectable survival checks and you only receive it as a class skill for the substitution levels, don't expect to be extremely good at it. This is a perfect alternative class level for fulfilling requirements for a certain prestige class or feat you need.
 4th level: Give up turn undead to sunder followers of Loviatar. It's just too specific to be useful.
 6th level: Gain weekly uses of delay poison instead of remove disease. Ok trade. Again, as with Zone of Truth, Delay Poison is just a second level paladin spell and with just two more levels you can cast both Remove Disease and Delay Poison if need be. Only take this if you absolutely know that you'll be facing lots of poison-using enemies, e.g. if you're campaigning against the Drow or the followers of Loviatar.</dd>

 <dt>Red Falcon <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>Add Knowledge(History) to the skill list at each substitution level.
 2nd level: Trade divine grace for a below average ability. Bad. Actually the ability is not that bad and since the AC bonus is insight, it works on your touch AC, too; essentially a 'no' to enemy spellcasters that target you with rays and spells that require ranged attack rolls. However, the ability can be used limited times per day (albeit at immediate action speed) and it replaces Divine Grace which is one of the best Paladin class features.
 4th level: Swap three of your turn attempts for an extended spell list - Augury, Deathwatch and Status. The trade is ok if you really want some or all of those spells, it's better to lose three turn attempts than your whole turning ability altogether; however note that none of these spells are groundbreaking and deathwatch has the [Evil] descriptor, which is just weird.
 6th level: This is a very good substitution level, since you're just trading a 1st level spell slot for a free Extend Spell on one of your paladin buffs, regardless of level - and you don't even have to possess the feat. In addition, virtually for free, all your cohorts and followers can be trained in the use of a martial weapon as long they remain in your service and you regularly train them; they don't all have to be trained in the use of the same weapon, so you can grant different proficiencies to different cohorts and followers.</dd>

 <dd>d8 hit die, add Bluff and Perform(dance, oratory, sing, string instruments) to the skill list at each substitution level.
 3rd level: Divine health has more uses. I don't know what I was thinking, but making you immune to effects that deal damage or drain to your charisma, probably a statistic you'll want to be high, is very good. Protects against certain character optimization staple spells or powers, such as Ego Whip and the feat Twist the Knife.
 6th level: Heroism per week instead of Remove Disease. Normally it would be superior, but i think that on weekly basis, remove disease is better. Actually the trade is more or less equal; either you select an effect that removes negative conditions from your teammate (or you, assuming you traded Divine Health for Enduring Personality) or you get a combat buff that grants morale bonuses, so it will be useful for many levels. A note is that if your party features a Bard, you're better off with Remove Disease as most of their buffs are morale effects, too.
 12th level: Nice buff, but not worth it the 3rd level slot. In any way, don't advance to 12 level just for this.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Vigilant Eye of Helm <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>1st level: This is an ok trade and see invisibility is free. You can't actually detect invisible enemies, since this ability depends on your normal senses, but you it is activated automatically and doesn't require an action from your part - unlike Detect Evil. It's very good when you're leading your teammates against groups of enemies and not facing a single foe, because you can direct your strongest debuffs and abilities towards the strongest of your opponents; this ability updates automatically if certain foes leave the battlefield or die! In addition you get to add See Invisibility to your paladin spell list.
 3rd level: Not worth it for divine health. Actually, this ability is not that bad at all, especially if you're using the Complete Adventurer rules for the Aid another action, which rules that you can give scalling bonuses to your teammates when using that function, according to your base attack bonus or if you're sporting an Amulet of Teamwork from Magic Item Compendium. You also get to use this special aid another action as a move action, so you get to attack or use your standard action as you see fit.
 4th level: You do trade turn undead, but awesome blow is a very nice feat. Indeed it's not that bad of a feat, but you must know what you're doing; the Awesome Smite entry doesn't mention whether you have to get a -4 penalty on your attack roll to activate it or it is activated just by virtue of spending your smite evil attempt. Even then, you must optimize your attack damage, because that's the saving throw difficulty class against your awesome smite. Finally, because you're only going to have the chance to use this ability once or twice per day, until really late levels, it's best if you stick with turn undead and pass on this feature.</dd>

 <dd>Add Listen and Spot to the skill list at each substitution level, 4+int skill points at each substitution level.
 3rd level: This is a nice trade for halfling frontliners. You won't regret it. I find being protected against fear tactics (immunity to fear effects) and in addition providing a big bonus to your teammates against the same effects is more important than getting bonuses against opposed checks; this only works if you want to be able to utilize trip effectively, so only get it if you're planning on following that route.
 4th level: This on the other hand isn't worth it. You can gain uncanny dodge with a lowly feat. 
 6th level: The Haste spell is one of the best 3rd level spells in the game and it does not appear on the Paladin spell list. It is definitely worth the trade of the standard Remove Disease spell-like ability, since you are able to use it every day instead of weekly.</dd>

 <dd>Add Perform to the skill list at each substutition level.
 1st level: Mediocre. The problem is that they don't get better as you gain levels. They might, but inspire courage is better than detect evil and these substitution levels offer you perform as a class skill, which means that you can take the feat From Smite to Song from the first level (inspire courage for a smite attempt, look at the feats section).
 6rd level: As above. Remove disease is not that useful, but inspire competence is not going to be useful, either. Only get this if you want to qualify for a feat or prestige class. 
 9th level: On the other hand, inspire greatness is a lot better than an extra use of remove disease. What really shines for this ability is the 2 bonus hit dice people affected receive. That is an average of 11 bonus hit points and the difference between life and death in certain situations (like spells that only check your hit dice , like dictum, holy word, etc). You can also get Words of Creation, a feat from Book of Exalted Deeds, which will double your inspire courage ability and also give you four bonus hit dice from inspire greatness.</dd>

 4th level: You get Favored Enemy(Humanoid) without a trade and you're free to choose to which subtype your favored enemy class feature will apply. Unlike Holy Judge's Favored Enemy(Devils), this ability actually seems that it advances any other favored enemies you might have (from Ranger levels for instance).
 6th level: You get Hide in Plain Sight and you don't trade anything. This level coupled with respectable ranks in the hide skill will make you able to act as a stealth knight! Remember that you can use Whisper Gnomes which receive better land speed and improved hide and move silently bonuses.
 9th level: Again without trading anything, get 1/day Invisibility.</dd>

 <h1>Charisma Synergies</h1>
 
 <p>The X stat to Y bonus thread is a very useful tool for determining what type of synergies you can acquire, as well as their investment (just by looking the type of the entry - for example a feat is probably easier to qualify for than a prestige class - or with some book search). The tables can be sorted by column (just click on the column name), which is handy for different searches; for instance you might be looking of ways to get charisma as a bonus to your attack roll - then just click on the "bonus" column; or you might be looking for specific books as sources - click on the "book" column; or you might just want a feat or item, because your build is already planned and well-thought out - click on the "type" column.</p>
 <p>Using that table I've generated the following results for easy reference (note that I've stripped all the entries that are not 3.5 (e.g. 3.0, PF) or they're from a dragon magazine).</p>

 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Leadership <div class="book">PHB</div></dt>
 <dd>This is one of the best feats you can acquire both for flavor and optimization reasons. Most DMs ban this outright. Paladins have a special mount and unless they swap that class feature for an alternative one, they are already looking at -2 points, however, since your leadership score is the sum of your level and your charisma modifier and you're able to receive most positive modifiers to your score just by doing your job right (great renown - fairness and generosity), raising your score high enough to effectivelly get another player character under your control will be extremely easy. Don't forget about followers, too - they can also be used, even though their combat effectiveness will be limited (you'll require resources to keep them around with you and they're too weak to survive direct confortation), unless the situation is a siege of your personal keep, where they will mostly be using ranged weapons. To optimize the Leadership feat even more, you can check out Heroes of Battle, which features some feats that can boost several aspects of the leadership feat (Extra Followers, Improved Cohort, Practiced Cohort, Inspirational Leadership). More sources: Legendary Commander ELH, Epic Leadership ELH, Dragon Cohort DrN, Undead Leadership LM, Might Makes Right RoF.</dd>

 <dt>Practiced Spellcaster <div class="book">CD</div></dt>
 <dd>As a paladin you'll have very bad caster level - just half your paladin level; the problem is that if you favor buffs that benefit from caster level (like for duration, effects and so on), practiced spellcaster can be used to pump it up a bit. Remember that if you're planning to use it, it has a spellcraft skill requirement of 4 ranks, which is a cross-class skill for the paladin class.</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Goad <div class="book">CV</div></dt> 
 <dd>Great for charismatic front liners. You can attract an enemy and survive since paladins are usually nice tanks, but also save a weak opponent. This feat is not that great, because it has multiple restrictions and only prohibits melee attacks on your teammates. However, it's a great feat for your starting levels and you can opt to retrain it later; this is because it will start to lose effectiveness as you'll start encountering enemies with different movement modes than land speed - for instance any flying creature is difficult to goad, unless you also possess a flying speed or the creature has a large threat range. The controversial thing with this feat is that it is based more on your opponent, than on you (except from the DC of course), because it relies on his or her threat range. This feat is very good against opponents with weak will saves that either have large reach or require mobility to be effective (e.g. chargers); in addition, assuming that your opponent is only dangerous with his melee attacks, you can use this to save a weaker ally, by forcing the enemy attack you.</dd>

 <dt>Draconic Aura <div class="book">DrM</div></dt>
 <dd>Project a draconic aura. This is very useful and flavors with the auras/buffing effects the paladin already has. Indeed, this is very good feat and fits the class thematically, assuming you've got the [dragonblood] subtype. The best thing is that this feat provides a great deal of versatility: you've got a wide selection of auras to choose from and most will benefit all the members of a party. Obviously you should check with your teammates and choose an aura that boosts the party's most important abilities. The Energy aura is very good to help a primary spellcaster that employs spells of a particular energy type - e.g. a spellcaster that specializes in cold using the Snowcasting feat - that way you can provide him with a pretty good bonus to his difficulty class. Note that the same applies to any ability that has the appropriate descriptor or deals damage of the chosen type, so, for example, it might help a Dragonfire Adept, too; the Insight aura will be mostly useless - the only use I can think of that will benefit a party is if most of your allies grab the Knowledge Devotion feat; if your party features more than one offensive spellcasters, then they will probably love the free Spell Penetration feat(s) provided by the Power aura; Presense boosts the social skills Bluff, Diplomacy and Intimidate - while these skills are all worthwhile, unless your party uses the demoralize combat action, it's not worth it to boost them via an aura; the Resistance aura is good for the first levels - a party that will crusade against pyromaniacs will gladly get the extra protection, but after some levels the energy protection will quickly lose effectiveness; Resolve helps against fear, paralysis, sleep effects and concentration checks, but it doesn't boost any other saving throws - you're already immune to fear, you give a +4 morale bonus to your teammates and getting a +4 max bonus on saves versus paralysis and sleep effects, while useful, isn't good enough; Senses is probably the best non-specialist (that is, if you exclude situations that another aura is more useful, because of your party composition) aura you can pretty much acquire - at the end you're essentially giving everyone a little more than three bonus feats (Improved Initiative, Skill Focus[Spot], Skill Focus[Listen]). Having good spot and listen checks is fine, but the important thing here is the initiative bonus; i don't really like the Stamina aura, but the bonus to fortitude saves is well worth it; Swiftness is another great choice for parties that value mobility (or lack in that sense) - the skill boni are good, but getting +10ft movement speed to all movement modes at an early level (7th) to all of your party members for just one feat is heavenly; and finally, the Toughness aura is obviously not worth it, since it can be easily bypassed by magic weapons.</dd>

 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Daunting Presence[Retrain] <div class="book">LM</div></dt>
 <dd>A charisma based will save feat that can make opponents shaken. Since most paladins will not have the Intimidate skill as a class skill, if your party employs demoralize/fear tactics and you want to participate, then this feat will make it happen. Note that this has to be used as an opening or finishing move versus an opponent - it makes people shaken, but it has no effect if a creature is already shaken; it arguably works versus targets that are frightened (since shaken + shaken = frightened, your target is no longer shaken), so, for instance, you can open with daunting presence, have someone make your target shaken again and then use your daunting presence once again to make him panicked. Daunting presense has a charisma-based difficulty class and scales as you level up, because it's based on your hit dice; moreover it's a ranged ability - you don't have to be threatening the enemy with your weapons, just to have a staredown contest! As you gain levels, if your enemies are frequently immune to fear or mind-affecting effects, or you just have better things to spend your standard action on, you can just retrain it</dd>

 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Avenging Strike <div class="book">ToB</div></dt>
 <dd>Unless if you are going to deal with creatures who possess the evil subtype, take this. Otherwise it's not worth it. Note that this works if the outsider has the evil subtype, regardless of alignment (it means that you can avenging strike paladin outsiders for example that have the evil subtype). Avenging strike is a very elegant feat that would probably be a very popular choice among those builds that favor charisma synergies, but, unfortunately, it can only be used on specific creatures - those outsiders with the [Evil] subtype. Since it requires you to have a good alignment, that probably means that you're thinking of a build featuring the traditional paladin class, so you will almost definitely encounter evil outsiders at some point in the campaign, but whether they will be enough to justify you picking this feat is debatable. Check with your DM - if you're going to delve into the Abyss or Nine Hells, then it's a quite good pick; otherwise it's better to pass on it. Another little detail: it probably is a typo, but, as written, if you use a swift action to empower your attacks, that energy lasts until your next attack - it doesn't have a duration (like 1 round), so you can probably prebuff your weapon with it (although it will be discharged on your next attack, whether you hit an outsider with the [Evil] subtype or not) so that you can use your swift action on something else.</dd>

 <dt>Dilate Aura <div class="book">FCII</div></dt>
 <dd>Double your aura's range once per encounter for rounds equal to your charisma modifier. Mediocre. Indeed, it's not an ability to die for, but I wanted to note that a paladin with many followers from the Leadership feat will probably make the best use of this feat. Too bad that as written you can only enlarge only one of your auras.</dd>

 <dt>Sword of the Arcane Order <div class="book">CoV</div></dt> 
 <dd>This is a gem. One of the best feats for paladins out there. To elaborate on this beautiful feat: it enables you to memorize sorcerer/wizard spells in your paladin slots, using your own spellbook or a borrowed one; in addition your wizard caster level is treated as the sum of your wizard, paladin and ranger levels. So, to list the disadvantages, since the advantages are pretty obvious: you can't dump Intelligence, as you'll need it in order to cast wizard spells through this feat; since you're not going to have a really high intelligence modifier or the ability to use high level spells, you're restricted almost exclusively to buffs; you're restricted to specific deities (Azuth or Mystra), even though that's not really a problem, since Mystra's order, Knights of the Mystic Fire, features some sweet substitution levels; it is unclear whether you can have a spellbook without levels in the wizard (or wu jen) class - if you can only get your own spellbook by dipping those classes, you can either choose to dip or invest in spellcraft and use borrowed spellbooks - be warned that the spellcraft DCs to memorize spells from borrowed spellbooks are quite high, at 15+spell level; the way that the caster level calculation for wizards is worded, seems to debuff caster level and to always set it at wizard + ranger + paladin levels, making feats like Practiced Spellcaster worthless - it wouldn't be that way if the ability was just "you add your paladin and ranger levels to your wizard caster level" - I don't think this is RAI, though, and it will rarely matter, since you'll need to dip 4 levels in the Paladin class anyway. An issue you'd most probably like to clear with your DM is whether the spells you cast using this feat are arcane or divine. In the case they are arcane, you'd have the additional restriction that they are subject to arcane spell failure, but you'll be able to qualify for prestige classes, feats, abilities or items that require you to be able to cast arcane spells and activate eternal wands. In the case they are divine, they are not subject to arcane spell failure, but you'll be able to use them in conjunction with abilities that only work on divine spells (for instance the Divine Metamagic feat, check Complete Divine's errata) and create scrolls of arcane spells that are treated as divine spells (your Archivist party member will love you).</dd>

 <dt>From Smite to Song <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>Spend a smite attempt to activate a inspire courage effect with effective bard level equal to your paladin level. Average feat. I used to think that, but actually this feat has a number of uses. First of all inspire courage is one of the best bard songs and the most common target of optimization (boosting its bonuses via feats and items); you only spend a feat to get the best class feature of a class and it automatically scales, too! The downside is that it scales according to your paladin level, which is not that good, because you'll normally want to prestige out as quickly as possible. In addition, it requires you to worsip Milil, a deity that offers some interesting substitution levels; if you get the first level of Harmonious Knight, you'll be able to get this feat from your first level (as it requires 3 ranks of perform and the substitution level makes perform a class skill for you).</dd>

 <dd>A gem. Auto quicken nearly everything on your spell list. A must if you are going to value spellcasting. In truth Battle Blessing does not affect nearly everything on your spell list, but over 100 paladin spells benefit from it. Since this feat only works with paladin spells, you'll most probably have to stay in the class, or choose prestige classes that advance spellcasting; this is actually a negative, but you can work something out by selecting alternative class features and abilities that depend on your paladin level (for instance the From Smite to Song feat, or the Charging Smite alternative class feature). What Battle Blessing does for your combat buffs is invaluable - it can be used on helpful combat spells such as Divine Favor, Bull's Strength, Holy Sword, Magic Circle against Evil, Protection from Evil, Shield Other and you are free to full attack or even employ another buff (assuming it originaly had a casting time of 1 round, since you only have one swift action per round, normally).</dd>

 <dd>This is not necessary, but it's there if you are continually using smite attempts. As written, you probably get two additional smite attempts that you can use for various smite class features. It's obviously a good feat for your starting levels and if you get enough smite attempts to use per day, you can retrain it for something better. Unfortunately it requires four points of BAB, so you won't be able to pick it up as a starting feat - where it's probably most needed</dd>

 <dd>This is nice if you have a problem with overcoming damage reduction. Also useful if you have also other kinds of smite. Indeed, this is an option if you have problems with damage reduction, but the paladin class is feat-starved, so it's better that you let your equipment take care of it; fortunately you're getting a mild damage boost to your smite attacks, but unless you've got a lot of them, don't bother with this feat; it's only worth taking if you've got a large amount of smite attempts per day and if they are 'special', meaning that they're not aligned, but affect something else, for instance, the smite the Killoren race gets</dd>

 <dd>Use this if you are going to encounter fire based creatures, such as fire dragons. This feat is so bad, that even against fire based creatures - that is creatures that have the [Fire] subtype - can be worthless, as it adds just elemental damage, easily negated by spells and abilities. On the plus side, you do get a bonus smite attempt and you can convert other smites (but only from character levels or cleric domains, so Killorens are out) to "smite fiery foe"s, but unless you're convinced that you're going to be constantly battling creatures with the [Fire] subtype at relatively early levels, better stay away from this one</dd>

 <dt>Ranged Smite Evil <div class="book">BoED</div></dt> 
 <dd>You can use a smite evil attempt through a ranged weapon. Great if you want to play a ranged paladin. The other alternative, is using the elf paladin substitution levels, but obviously that option has two main drawbacks: you've got to be an elf and the weapon selection to deliver smite evil attacks is restricted to longbows and shortbows (with their composite versions), however, it doesn't eat up a feat. Both versions share the same drawback: you can only smite evil with them and you can't use other smite types</dd>

 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Smiting Power <div class="book">CoV</div></dt>
 <dd>Smiting power is not very powerful, but it can be used as a connection between your innate paladin powers and special combat maneuvers, should you decide to use them. Between the overrun and the bull rush maneuver, the latter is easier to optimize without sacrificing too much of the resources available to you; selecting some feats (Knockback RoS, Jotunbrud RoF, etc) or items (Brutal Surge enhancement MIC) or even the Dungeoncrusher Fighter variant (just a 2 level dip is required), will greatly increase your bull rushing capabilities and Smiting power will add charisma synergy to the mix</dd>
 </div>
 
 <div class="colorcode black">
 <dt>Awesome Smite <div class="book">CC</div></dt>
 <dd>Ignore some damage reduction points, trip opponents or ignore miss chances against opponents you smite. Great maneuvers. This feat enables you to use three maneuvers; each of which requires that you make a smite attack while using the Power Attack feat (minimum attack penalty -1). As written, this feat enables you to use the maneuvers, whether your target is valid for your smite type or not. Demolishing Smite will easily cut through any damage reduction - it ignores damage reduction points up to twice your charisma modifier, which, will easily be 6+; Overwhelming Smite is a weird one - if you hit and deal damage with your attack you can treat your attack as though it was a trip maneuver; if you get your hands on Improved Trip somehow, you immediately gain another attack against your opponent! So it's like using a smite attempt to gain a free attack (other certain conditions of course, but it can work) - however note that tripping is not always effective (e.g. against flyers); finally, Seeking Smite will enable your attack to negate any miss chance your opponent might have, which is very useful against many buffs (Displacement for instance)</dd>

 <dt>Divine Might <div class="book">CW</div></dt>
 <dd>Add your charisma to damage for 1 full round. This provides even more charisma synergy. Great feat. Just to note that Divine Might increases your charisma synergy, but you will be able to use it less than 10 times per day, unless your charisma modifier is really high and you don't have to spend turn attempts to power other divine feats. Obviously, since divine might affects appies to the attacks that you make in a full round, to get the most out of this feat you need to get more attacks per round; however, the Two Weapon Fighting feat line is out, as it requires a lot of dexterity investment on your part, which, as a Paladin, is not a good option. A great solution to get more attacks per round is to acquire secondary natural weapons, such as claws, tail, bite, etc - you will attack with a big penalty (-5 modifier to attacks), but that applies only to your secondary natural weapons - not your original attack sequence. Another note is that if you want to play a Paladin that utilizes ranged weapons (maybe using the elven substitution levels), Divine Might applies to all weapon damage, not just melee ones! Of course, to qualify for it you need to have Power Attack.</dd>

 <dt>Divine Shield <div class="book">CW</div></dt>
 <dd>Close relative to divine might, this feat makes you a walking fortress and has a pretty nice duration. This is another feat that will enhance your charisma synergy. Unlike Divine Might, Divine Shield has a scaling duration, which increases according to your character level; this enables you to save some turn attempts to fuel other divine feats, as you won't have to activate it each round. The bad news is that you'll have to spend the first round of combat to power up your shield, as activating Divine Shield takes a standard action. If you somehow manage to squeeze two fighter feats in your build (possibly dipping into fighter or psychic warrior) you can grab Shield Specialization PHB II and Shield Ward PHB II; the first is rather uninteresting and dull - it just increases your shield AC by one point with the selected shield group (light, heavy or buckler), but it grants you access to the second feat, which will let you add your shield bonus to AC (remember that figure is enhanced by Diving Shield) to your touch AC and checks or rolls to resist attack options like bull rush, disarm, grapple, trip or overrun</dd>

 <dd>If you are wearing heavy armor, your speed will be greatly reduced. This not only pumps your speed, but also provides you with 2 temporary hit points/level. The effect has a duration of minutes/level. Great feat. Actually the feat is good, but the activation is not; if you're going to spend a round buffing, you are not going to do it for some temporary hit points and bonuses to speed; this is only useful if you know that you are going to face an enemy within minutes, which makes it a luxury feat</dd>

 <dd>Probably not useful to you as to clerics, you are better off with metamagic rods. I don't know what I was thinking about this - it's obviously very good, but you'll have to commit some resources to make it work. For example, getting the crowd favourite DMM(Persistent Spell) you'll have to reserve three feat slots and the amount of turn undead attempts you will have to sink into this feat will make you unable to take any other divine feats. The main problem is that paladins do not have many spells that are worth it to be made persistent; the most common choices are Bless, Divine Favor, Blessed Aim, Divine Sacrifice, Strength of Stone, Find the Gap, Prayer, Sacred Haven, Blessing of the Righteous. If you are allowed to persist wizard spells by using the Sword of Arcane Order feat, then a whole lot of options open up for you - for instance using the Thunderlance spell which creates a lance of force with great reach made out of pure force, which will let you attack and deal damage using your charisma instead of your strength modifier. If the sourcebook Complete Champion is not available, you can use DMM(Quicken Spell) to quick cast some buffs in-combat, because that will bar access to the Battle Blessing feat. Finally, you can probably make use of DMM(Empower Spell) because there are some combat buffs with variable effects</dd>

Exactly because it can potentially affect enemies, you need to spend a full-round action to activate it  (!) and it requires 8 ranks in heal, which is not the most essential of skills and the effect is nothing to die for, just more healing, this feat can only situationaly justify its appearance on a paladin build.

If you're looking to make the best out of the monk dip, take a look at the Overwhelming Attack variant monk from Unearthed Arcana, which can set up a charging base for Shock Trooper and similar feats, the Feign Death or Invisible Fist or Spell Reflection alternative class features if you're looking for ways to get rid of your Evasion ability, the Decisive Strike variant that replaces Flurry of Blows with something that's more useful (you can also combine it with Scorpion Kama from Magic Item Compendium).
