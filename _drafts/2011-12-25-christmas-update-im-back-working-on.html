So my thesis is complete as of friday evening, so I can spend a little time with my family and friends and continue working on my handbooks!<br /><br />My current list is:<br /><br />1) Update and finish up the Paladin's handbook, which based on google analytics is a crowd favourite, along with the Duskblade one, with over 3000 unique page views.<br />2) Continue working on the Wizard handbook, although that thing is a monster. I'm going to try to write up a method of efficiently judging whether a spell is good or not; I think that's a better approach than just having another boring handbook suggesting good spells once again.<br />3) Port the "Druid, the ultimate CO build", with level by level instructions on creating a character optimization staple druid build - the main focus will be customization and maxing potential without investing much or using retraining options to swap features. I wanted to do this for a long time, because when "druid 20 or cleric 20" is suggested to a new player, he's completely at a loss on what to do.<br /><br />So here it is! If you've got any suggestions or requests, feel free to comment.
