    <h1>Skills</h1> <p>Wizards receive a low amount of skill points per level. However if you consider that most wizards have a starting intelligence of 15-16+ they easily get 5+ skill points when they level up. They aren't exactly skill monkeys, but they can max out several useful skills.</p> <h3>Class Skills</h3> <dl><div class="colorcode blue"><dt>Concentration</dt>  <dd>This skill makes you able to avoid losing spells to stressful situations, enables you to cast defensively and even cast spells with somatic components when grappled (this mode appears in the <i>Epic Level Handbook&nbsp;</i>and you may not be able to utilize it). &nbsp;Of course, theoretically, it would be best that you wouldn't have to make concentration rolls in the first place, but spending one skill point per level for a skill that might enable you to use your spells is a small price to pay and might make some difference. &nbsp;In addition, a great deal of prestige classes require some ranks in this skill.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode blue"><dt>Craft</dt>  <dd><strike>While crafting is for lowly peasants, there are quite a few prestige classes that list it as a requirement. Crafting alchemical items can be quite efficient at low to mid levels</strike>. &nbsp;I used to think so, but after pondering that with a low skill point investment and a big intelligence modifier you can easily hit the skill checks for many craft skills, it's a good idea to sink some points here. Remember that you can probably use the Take 10 action on your craft skills, since you're paying attention and you're probably not distracted at that time - this is supported by many spells or effects (for instance, the <i>Unseen Crafter </i>spell). Also remember that you can heal warforged (or heal yourself if you are a warforged). If you've got access to Eberron material, you can use the <i>Unseen Crafter </i>spell to do your job (preferably inside a portable hole or a bag of holding - if that's possible), while you're busy adventuring.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Decipher Script</dt>  <dd>Nice skill, but you can always use your spells to duplicate it. No need to spend skill points in this one. </dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Knowledge</dt>  <dd>Now this is something important. Intelligence will be one of your highest attributes and knowledges provide useful information on your opponents. The best course of action is for the party to split the various knowledges that creature types are related to. However since you have the skill points to spend, you can take quite a few. Consult the chart below for creature types and areas of knowledge relation:<br /><br />Arcana: Constructs, Dragons, Magical Beasts. <br />Dungeoneering: Aberrations, Oozes.<br />Local: Humanoids (Native local humanoids probably)<br />Nature: Animals, Fey, Giants, Monstrous Humanoids, Plants, Vermin.<br />Religion: Undead.<br />Planes: Outsiders, Elementals.<br /><br />As you can see, the nature area of knowledge provides tremendous amount of information on creatures. A close second is Arcana, which every wizard should have, since it's the area related to his own profession. Knowledge on the planes offers quite a few information, since outsiders are a pretty large category. Knowledge on religion area is quited limited, but no one can neglect undead.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Profession</dt>  <dd>I'd dump this. You can gain a lot more by selling your spells or crafting stuff. Also wisdom isn't actually important to you.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Spellcraft</dt>  <dd>This is one of the skills you would like to max out. Its applications are many and help identifying opponent's magical defenses, counterspelling, following tracks, learning new spells, identify potions and generally understand magical effects. Every wizard should possess this.</dd></div></dl> <h3>Cross-Class Skills</h3> <h3>Skill Tricks</h3>     <b><span style="color: blue;">Craft (Alchemy)</span> </b> <b><sup></sup></b><b>1+ ranks</b><b></b><b>:</b> It's a good idea to put at least one rank here. You can craft alchemical items, which are handy, nonmagical devices. Crafting these devices is better, because it cuts the cost of acquiring them to one third. Good items include tanglefoot bags, smokesticks and thunderstones. To use this skill effectively, you need at least a check result of 20-25.   <dl> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Slumber Sand <sup>SS, DC 12</sup></dt><dd>It's like scrolls of <i><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/sleep.htm">Sleep</a>&nbsp;</i>that are a little bit more powerful and can be used by anyone. It's expensive for what it does, so only use sparringly - it's useful for the first two levels anyway.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Bitterleaf Oil <sup>RotD, DC 15</sup></dt><dd>These oils will help you heal up at a very slow rate - they cost 25gp, but they're good for 10 applications each time. I'm assuming here that they don't only work for kobolds - probably other races can use them and take advantage of their healing powers. For the first few levels, if you don't have a source that is able to heal large amounts of hit point damage, you can use this oil. It's very cost effective if you craft it - each bottle can be used multiple times and each application heals 1 to 5 hit points, so that's 10 to 50 hit points healed at a cost of 25/3 = 8.333 gp, which results to 0.833 to 0.166 healing ratio (gp/hp healed); compared to the 1.363 ratio that the wand of lesser vigor has it's superior, but unfortunately it can be used only every time you rest.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Forger's Paper <sup>CS, DC 20</sup></dt><dd>The forgery skill is resisted only by forgery; characters that possess forgery are rare and if you only take some ranks in it your checks will be unbeatable, thus only 'light' skill optimization is needed. Forger's paper is a very handy item that will boost your forgery check result by 2, at a very low cost (10gp, which is 1/3rd that if you choose to craft it yourself). It also stacks with a forgery kit.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Alchemical Flare Stake <sup>EtCR, DC 20</sup></dt><dd>If you're in a campaign that deals with corporeal undead, this is an extremely potent weapon for the first few levels; you can only use this once, as it is consumed after a <i>successful </i>attack, but after you embed it in a corporeal undead creature's body, it deals 1d6 damage <i>per round </i>(the effect has no maximum number of rounds), but the creature can dislodge all stakes with a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The flares are treated like daggers for proficiency purposes (so the wizard class is proficient in them), but it's unclear whether they can be thrown or not; obviously attacking with them from a distance is superior to a class like the wizard.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Ironthorn Extract <sup>SS, DC 20</sup></dt><dd>Very good substance that can be used in a variety of situations. Its main purpose is to stiffen items, so you can use it to make delicate items harder and containers waterproof; mechanically, if you apply the extract to your clothing, you get a +1 armor bonus to AC, but as written, it can only enhance normal clothing - leather armors get better hardness and hit points. If you're not wearing armor, for whatever reason, this is a very cheap way of getting a mild boost, just to round up your character and give some "finishing touches".&nbsp;</dd></div> <div class="colorcode blue"><dt>Atramen Oil <sup>PlH, DC 20</sup></dt><dd>Bingo! As a ranged touch attack (your familiar can deliver it, too!) you get a powerful effect that imposes a -4 penalty to fort saves for 1 minute to your target <u>and</u>&nbsp;-1 to anyone within 5ft of the point where the flask hits. Needless to say, this is a very powerful effect, since it does not allow a save to avoid, for just 16.6 gp a use if you craft it yourself. If you plan on specializing on save-or-die or save-or-suck spells, don't pass on this.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Antitoxin <sup>PHB, DC 20</sup></dt><dd>&nbsp;Nothing fancy here - it's a +5 alchemical bonus for 1 hour to saving throws against poison. It costs 16.6 per dose if you craft it yourself and it's useful if you know that you're going to encounter an enemy that employs poison attacks. It's just alright and it's very cheap to keep some doses around, just in case.&nbsp;</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Endurance Elixir <sup>CS, DC 20</sup></dt><dd>This is a very cheap substance (just 8.3 gp a pop) that might prove useful when in extreme hot or cold environments. The duration is long (12 hours) and the bonus quite generous (+4 alchemical).&nbsp;</dd></div> <div class="colorcode blue"><dt>Tanglefoot Bag <sup>PHB, DC 25</sup></dt><dd>These would be perfect if they weren't so heavy. The key point to this item is that it is relatively cheap, at 16.6 gp, and it almost always works, as (at least according to how I read the item description) the saving throw affects whether the creature is glued to the floor or not. This item is good because the <i>Entangle </i>spell is good - debuffing without a saving throw or a way to be immune to the effect is important, especially since you can hand these to your teammates (or your familiar) and save actions.&nbsp;</dd></div> <div class="colorcode blue"><dt>Auran Mask <sup>CM, DC 25</sup></dt><dd>This mask-like alchemical item lasts for an hour and provides a +5 circumstance bonus against inhaled toxins (which stacks with antitoxin!). If you're underground, you're getting 10 minutes of water-breathing. The item costs 60gp normally, so if you craft it you can easily make one for each party member without investing large amounts of gold.&nbsp;</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Noxius Smokestick <sup>ECS, DC 25</sup></dt><dd>&nbsp;Pretty good item at early levels, when you're most likely to encounter creatures that are not immune to being nausated and they have pretty low fortitude saves, as that 15 DC isn't going to stay strong for a long time. Especially good if you're immune to being nausated yourself, like, say, playing a Warforged.&nbsp;</dd></div> </dl> <b><span style="color: blue;">Armorsmithing</span> <sup>1+ ranks</sup>:&nbsp;</b> If no one else cares to do so, you can take up creating masterwork armor for your party, because it's a perfect way of cutting your expenses to one third: the cost might not be that much for higher levels, but it easily cut down expenses. Be warned that if you want to craft something that has a high cost, it will be difficult to complete your suit in time, as it can take several weeks!<br /><ul><li><b><span style="color: blue;">Thistledown Padded</span> <sup>RotW, DC 15</sup>:&nbsp;</b>+1 AC, 10 max dex, 0% ACF, 0 ACP, &nbsp;405 gp: many weeks of downtime is required to craft this item yourself and probably you won't make it during a normal game (assuming your craft armorsmithing bonus is around 6), but it's fairly easy to do it with a small bonus (4 from ranks, 4 from Int bonus, 2 from familiar's aid another and 2 from masterwork tools racks up to 12 bonus), so you can easily convince your DM that you have crafted it yourself earlier in your career. If you want a cheap armor that you will be able to put armor and spell enhancements on, this is a very good choice, with no downsides (aside from not being able to wear robes).&nbsp;</li></ul> <br /><b>Drawing </b> <b><sup></sup></b><b>0 or 1 rank</b><b></b><b>:</b> Required for creating magical tattoos.<br /><b>Painting </b> <b><sup></sup></b><b>0 or 1 rank</b><b></b><b>:</b> Required for creating magical tattoos.<br /><b>Calligraphy </b> <b><sup></sup></b><b>0 or 1 rank</b><b></b><b>:</b> Required for creating magical tattoos.<br /><b>Basketweaving </b> <b><sup></sup></b><b>1 rank</b><b></b><b>:</b> Because it's the most broken thing in the universe.
