<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Most people here know about my passion about D&amp;D optimization. However, I'd also like to inform you that I'm very much into boardgaming.<br /><br />A very good friend of mine, who's also passionate about boardgames, has started a new blog; you can find it at:<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://nerdymeeples.blogspot.com/">http://nerdymeeples.blogspot.com</a></span></b><br /><b><br /></b> I'd also like to inform everyone that I'm going to guest writing a series of articles over at Nerdy Meeples about optimal boardgame strategies for some popular boardgames! You can also check for updates on Nerdy Meeples' facebook page, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NerdyMeeples">here</a>.<br /><br />Stay tuned!</div>
