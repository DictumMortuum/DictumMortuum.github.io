Imbue familiar with spell ability<br /><br />caduceus&nbsp;bracers on musteval guardinal<br /><br />This  depends a little bit on how your DM likes you to use your familiar  (Does he let you simply have complete control?), but I like to have some  scripted actions for the familiar, so the question of "How does your  familiar know to do that?" doesn't come up.&nbsp; So, spells that's *always*  cast in certain situations are useful, like, "I always like to cast this  when x happens".&nbsp; <br /><br />So, buff spells like Haste is good.&nbsp; Always pop it at the beginning of combat.<br /><br />Another  line of spells that are useful are spells that get your wizard out of  certain troubles.&nbsp; Like the wizard *somehow* get grappled and mouth  covered so the wizard can't even cast Dimension Door or something.&nbsp; I  think I like Dimension Step, as this can be cast away from the wizard  (Hit by Silence, or something).&nbsp; And useful in general in many  situations.&nbsp; Since you have some Domain spells, you could give your  familiar some spells that can stabilize, or remove conditions off of the  wizard, in case your wizard's hit points go negative or get debuffed.<br /><br />Also,  another thing to consider is to give the familiar Orb of Force or  something, and just have readied action, in case an enemy caster starts  casting a spell.&nbsp; Pop the enemy caster with 50 points of damage, and  force the concentration check.&nbsp; Your wizard use pro-active spells, the  familiar goes defensive and have something reactive.<br /><br />Lastly,  Shield Other is another possible Domain spell to consider.&nbsp; Half the  damage you take, the familiar takes it.&nbsp; Use False Life on the wizard  himself, and share it with the familiar.&nbsp; Have a hero's feast, and as  long as the familiar is safely tucked away in familiar pocket, you are  doubling the effectiveness of those temporary hit points.&nbsp; Of course,  this does come with a risk that familiar might get into trouble if you  and the familiar both get hit by AoE spell...<br /><br />One more thing.&nbsp;  Remember Mageâ€™s Lucubration is Personal range spell you can share with  your familiar.&nbsp; You AND your familiar gets 1 spell back with only one  casting!<br /><br />Edit: Oh, ONE MORE thing.&nbsp; If there's a way to give your Familiar 'Harmonic Chorus' from CAdv (It's a Bard only spell)...<br /><br />&nbsp;SHARE:<br /><br /><b>True Casting</b> (sorcerer/wizard)<br />+10 <i>insight</i> to next caster level check.<br /><br /><b>Assay Spell Resistance</b> (cleric, sorcerer/wizard)<br />+10 to caster level checks against 1 creature.<br /><br /><b>Mystic Surge</b> (sorcerer/wizard)<br />+1 CL, +2 DC to next spell.<br /><br /><b>Spell Enhancer</b> (sorcerer/wizard)<br />+2 CL, +1 DC to next spell.<br /><br /><b>Spell Flower</b> (cleric, sorcerer/wizard)<br />Hold the charge on 1 touch spell per arm.<br /><br /><b>Arcane Spellsurge</b> (sorcerer/wizard, wu jen)<br />Shorter  casting time on arcane spells. Standard -&gt; swift / full round -&gt;  standard / up to 1 minute -&gt; 1 round shorter than usual.<br /><br /><b>Lesser Spell Matrix, Spell Matrix and Greater Spell Matrix</b> (sorcerer/wizard)<br />Store 1/2/3 third level spell(s) in the matrix to cast later as a swift action.<br /><br /><b>Arcane Fusion and Greater Arcane Fusion</b> (sorcerer)<br />Cast a level 4 spell and a level 1 spell simultaneously, without using spell slots for them. (Greater: 7 and 4)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;Blood wind + natural weapons<br /><br />
