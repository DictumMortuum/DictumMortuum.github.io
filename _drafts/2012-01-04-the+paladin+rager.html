I don't know many players that love playing barbarians and paladins and are not in love with the <em>Champion of Gwynharwyf</em> prestige class from the sourcebook&nbsp;<em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em>. It covers everything - damage reduction, rage progression, energy resistances, divine grace, spells, smite <u>and</u> immunities - it's almost unreal. I've been updating the <a href="http://dictummortuum.blogspot.com/2011/08/paladins-handbook.html">Paladin's Handbook</a> lately and most of the times I get build ideas and take notes, so that I won't forget about them, but everything fit into this build so nicely that I just wanted to write it down immediately.<br /><br /><strong>Assumptions:</strong><br /><ul><li>You can use Paladin substitution levels in conjunction with Paladin of Freedom.&nbsp;</li><li>You are using 32pb.&nbsp;</li><li>You can use Level Adjustment Buyoff.&nbsp;</li><li>You can adapt the Abjurant Champion prestige class to work with divine instead of arcane classes.</li><li>You can use flaws.&nbsp;</li></ul>Obviously the main components of the build are Paladin and Champion of Gwynharwyf (that's damn difficult to write every time - gonna use 'champion' from now on), but that's not possible, due to alignment restrictions. That's why I'm going to use Paladin of Freedom (Chaotic Good alignment) for this build. I'm going to assume that you can use the same substitution levels with Paladin of Freedom, especially the racial ones; after all they're both Paladins. Unfortunately, the classes overlap somewhat, since they both offer immunity to compulsion effects.<br /><br />There are two alternatives here: either go with the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> half-orc substitution levels (they also offer the intimidate skill as a class skill instead of diplomacy, which helps the champion's requirements) and a way to drop <em>Divine Grace</em> (the only way to do so is by selecting the 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;<em>Red Knight&nbsp;</em>substitution level); or just select all warforged substitution levels and stick with both immunities to compulsion. The first route has a problem with half-orc paladin's&nbsp;<em>Righteous Fury&nbsp;</em>and the smite evil attempts that are gained later from champion levels, because righteous fury explicitly states that you can never gain daily uses of smite evil, but you can safely assume either that it refers to the paladin class <u>only</u> or that champion's class levels stack for the purpose of righteous fury and you don't gain smite evil attempts from it - either way it's a good trade. The second route makes you immune to so many different abilities that you'll have not much use for your saving throws, it's basically an invulnerability build. Without doubt, this build is going to use the <em>Lion Totem&nbsp;</em>barbarian from&nbsp;<em>Complete Champion</em> that gives you the pounce ability.<br /><br />This time I'm going to use the Warforged as a race, in conjunction with the <em>Phrenic</em> template (remember we're assuming that LA buyoff rules are in effect) which will waive the attribute penalties the warforged race has to charisma and wisdom and provide some charisma synergy with the psi-like abilities it grants. So after applying the Phrenic template, the ability modifiers should be: +2 con, +2 int, +2 cha. Assuming 32 point buy rules and a spread of 14/10/16/8/14/15:<br /><br /><strong>Strength:&nbsp;</strong>14 + 6 enhancement = 20<br /><strong>Dexterity:&nbsp;</strong>10<br /><strong>Constitution:&nbsp;</strong>16 + 2 racial + 6 enhancement = 24<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Intelligence:&nbsp;</strong>8 + 2 racial = 10<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Wisdom:&nbsp;</strong>14<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Charisma:&nbsp;</strong>15 + 2 racial + 5 levels + 6 enhancement = 28<strong><br /></strong><br /><br />The build outline is:<br /><br />Barbarian 1/Paladin of Freedom 4/Abjurant Champion 1 (advancing paladin of freedom casting)/Champion of Gwynharwyf 7/Abjurant Champion +4/Champion of Gwynharwyf +3<br /><br /><strong>Feats:</strong><br />1) Righteous Wrath, Power Attack, Knight of Stars<br />3) Combat Casting<br />6)
