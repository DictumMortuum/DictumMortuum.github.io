I'm a busy man, but I also want to do my best to make my handbooks feel complete. I figured that instead of working to update a handbook and post it after a really long time, it would be better if I gradually showed you guys some of my work on a weekly basis; that would even make the material easier to comment on. Of course the updates will be incorporated into the handbooks. What do you think?
