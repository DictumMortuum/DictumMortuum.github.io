It seems that some days ago wizards of the coast released a .pdf version with the basic rules of 5th edition. You can find the pdf in this <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd%2Fbasicrules">article</a>.<br /><br />I'm excited about this and I will post my thoughts on the basic rules once I got the chance to read the pdf thoroughly.<br /><br />I really hope to continue writing guides for 5e :D<br /><br />
