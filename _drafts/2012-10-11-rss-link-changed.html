So, I've been meddling around with the blog's feed and found out that there's a limit of 512KB to the feed's size. The guides include large blocks of text and because of that they take the space pretty quickly; as a result the newer posts where not showing (because I've chosen to include everything in a post).<br /><br />Updating the feed wouldn't work correctly, so I deleted the old one and created a new one from the beggining :D I tested it and it works like a charm. Unfortunately the only way to fix the space limitation was to publish feeds that are up to the line breaks (to understand what I'm talking about, just check out the blog's main page - articles there show up to the line breaks).<br /><br />If you're interested, you can click the RSS link in the top right corner to add the blog's feed to your news reader.<br /><br />Thanks!
