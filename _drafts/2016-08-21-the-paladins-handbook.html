<a name='more'></a><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Why Paladin?</span></b><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">If someone asked me to bet on the class from Player's Handbook that most people would either love or hate, my money would be on the Paladin class. Most people have different feelings about it, but one thing is for sure: they are strong ones. Usually selected by new players, thinking that they will be able to play their dream-knight in shinning armor able to slay dragons, unfortunately they are usually left with a bitter disappointment. From a character optimization view, the class lacks potential. This guide is for those that want desperately to play a Paladin for their fluff, but also need a combat edge for their knightly adventures.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">In this guide i will try to explore the paladins and provide as many information as possible on them. Note that i will not focus only on the player's handbook class only, but also on the variant paladins as well. As such, don't be surprised if some feats/classes/abilities that can be only obtained by non good or evil characters are suggested.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><!--more--><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Attributes:</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Paladins usually act as the leader of a group and are able to cover the social role, with skills like diplomacy. They are able to minor buff party members with auras and other abilities and also receive some amount of damage. Paladins are usually melee characters, but as described above, they can assume additional secondary roles which makes them suffer from Multiple Attribute Dependence (MAD).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Strength</span>:</b> Paladins are usually melee characters. While this is not your first priority, a decent score (~14) will make you able to dish out some respectable damage, especially in the early levels. Remember to place at least a score of 13, so that you can at least acquire the Power Attack feat early on in your carrer. Later, with a stat boosting item you will be able to push this attribute to a higher comfort level. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dexterity: </b>If you choose this you must wear lighter armor and probably use ranged weapons. Aside from a few occasions, this is considered a dump stat, as you will most probably want to create the knightly image and use plate armor, which hinders your dexterity modifier.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: purple;">Constitution</span>:</b> This is important to a paladin as to any other character. Due to your role in combat, you are definitely going to have to survive large amounts of punishment. Fortunately the paladin class has good fortitude saves and comes with a modest built-in healing special ability (lay on hands), but this is not an excuse to invest lower than 14 in this attribute.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Intelligence</span>: </b>This is a dump stat to paladins due to the fact that you, well, won't be able to dump other stats. Due to their low skill points per level, paladins can't load up on many skills. Also it doesn't have other uses, except from the (powerful!) Faerunian feat Sword of Arcane Order from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786936975/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786936975&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><i>Champions of Valor</i></a>. However, this also means that you will be unable to take feats such as combat expertise, improved trip, etc. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as those abilities rarely tend to have synergy with the paladin class, but it does cut some options.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Wisdom</span>: </b><strike>This is your casting stat, as well the key ability for many of your skills. You can't dump this</strike>. Actually, even though this is your main casting statistic, it is debatable whether you actually need it to be high; this is because if you choose to multiclass out of the class, you will lose access to spells, too. Of course the other class might have wisdom-based spellcasting (as most paladin-based prestige classes have), so by all means I do not suggest that you dump wisdom, but just to add another consideration when planning your build. Even if you choose to stay as a paladin, you will not need higher than 12 wisdom for the first 8+ levels, assuming you don't care for spell DC and/or bonus spells. Finally, it is true that it boosts some of your skills (profession, sense motive and heal), but aside from sense motive you either don't have to boost them to warrant high attribute modifier or you don't really need them.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Charisma</span></b><b>: </b><strike>This is important for you for various abilities: turn undead, saves, smite. Also most paladin prestige classes use charisma for various class features</strike>. Most classes have a statistic that would like to raise to extremes, due to the fact that it boosts their class features and it synergizes with most of their feat and equipment options; for the paladin class, this statistic is charisma. It will give you more turn attempts, more attack power combined with smite, higher saves and empower many of the class abilities you will pick along the way. Note that even though charisma is so good and synergistic for the paladin class, don't over-do it, especially when using the point-buy system, as that will leave you exposed. You can milk some points from wisdom, dexterity and intelligence to safely get a 16 in charisma, but going higher without the benefits that spellcasters have is probably not worth it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bottom line:</b> Assuming you're in a 28 point buy game, a spread of 14/10/14/10/14/14 is gonna serve you fine. In case your stats are worse, you're better off lowering your wisdom to a minimum of 10-11 (you're not going to cast anything until level 4, so you can pump it with stat points later), your dexterity to a minimum of 8, or even your intelligence (if you choose to completely neglect skills - remember that you're always going to receive one skill point per level, no matter what). Elite array is probably best placed as: 13/8/14/10/12/15. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Races</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: purple;">Humans</span> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786928867/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786928867&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><sup>PHB</sup></a></b><b>: </b>The human race offers everything a paladin needs, as a package deal, except for stat boosts. Probably the best race from the optimization scope, this offers you the bonus feat that you need, the bonus skill points without having to load on intelligence and your favored class can be any class. Additionally, the stereotypical paladin-knight is usually a human in heavy armor, so this race option gives you a lot of fluff points, too. You can also select the Silverbrow Human subrace (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786939362/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786939362&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><i>Dragon Magic</i></a>) which loses the bonus skills, but gives you a few bonus abilities and retain the bonus feat. The biggest bonus is probably the dragonblood subtype, which increases the potential of several abilities (for instance, the feat Draconic Aura scales if you have the dragonblood subtype).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Dwarfs</span> </b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786928867/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786928867&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><b><sup>PHB</sup></b></a><b>:</b> They get a charisma hit, but they have nice features, including keeping their natural speed in any armor and stability. A hidden bonus to the dwarf race (and most of their sub-races), is that since their speed can't be hindered, they can tumble even in heavy armor. The paladin class doesn't offer tumble as a class skill, but you can swap ride for tumble using the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20070228a">Cityscape web enhancement</a>. You should seriously consider the other dwarf subraces, which do not receive a penalty to their charisma score, like Dream Dwarfs (<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786932783/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786932783&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">Races of Stone</a></i>) which have a penalty to dexterity instead. Another bonus that dwarfs have are the Crescent Moon Knight substitution levels, which you can access if you worship Clangeddin Silverbeard.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Elves</span> </b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786928867/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786928867&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><b><sup>PHB</sup></b></a><b>:</b> Unless you want to grab the substitution levels, there is no reason to take them.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Gnomes </b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786928867/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786928867&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><b><sup>PHB</sup></b></a><b>: </b>While the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786928867/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786928867&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><i>Player's Handbook</i></a> version isn't that suitable for a paladin, the gnome shadow cloak knight substitution levels are sweet. Actually, combined with Whisper Gnomes from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786932783/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786932783&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><i>Races of Stone</i></a>, a stealth knight would be a viable choice, even though that gnome subrace receives a charisma penalty (you can use clever use of templates - for instance the Draconic template with level adjustment buyoff to offset the charisma loss).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Half Orcs </b> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786928867/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786928867&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><b><sup>PHB</sup></b></a><b>:</b> As above, they get some nice substitution levels. The best subrace if you want to utilize those levels is Desert Half-Orc (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786931310/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786931310&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><i>Unearthed Arcana</i></a>), which has stat adjustments of +2 con and -2 int, it's great to get a bonus on a physical statistic that it's going to help and a penalty to a dump statistic - otherwise you're bound to lose some charisma.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Neanderthal </span><sup><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786928964/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786928964&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">FB</a></sup>:</b> +2 strength and constitution -2 dexterity and intelligence. Very nice race for paladins as it gets hits in the only stats you can dump and boosts those that have a big importance in battle.

They get an Evil Exception so you can use evil items without taking negative levels. They also receive several bonus devil touched feats, some of which have nice charisma related uses. Alternatively you can choose the aspect that grants bonus to charisma: it may come with a hit to your constitution, but you'll eventually get telepathy and access to the feat Mindsight (Lords of Madness), which will turn you to a huge asset to your party.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Dragonborn of Bahamut</span> <sup><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786939133/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786939133&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">RotD</a></sup>:</b> Bonus to constitution and hit to dexterity.

Can't get much better than this. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Aura of Good (Ex):</b> Your aura strength is equal to your paladin level. While this has mild effects, you can stun evil creatures detecting you. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Detect Evil (Sp): </b>Unlimited times per day, detect evil as per the spell. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Smite Evil </span>(Su):</b> This is the signature ability of the paladin. The power to deal extra damage with enhanced accuracy to evil beings. It is charisma based and deals damage based on your paladin level. As you gain levels, you gain more smite evil attempts.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Divine Grace </span>(Su):</b> Gain an unnamed bonus to all your saving throws equal to your charisma modifier. Many builds dip into paladin only for this ability. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Lay on Hands (Su): </b>Cure some damage on yourself or your companions or damage undead. This ability depends on charisma.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Aura of Courage</span> (Su): </b>Give a large bonus to companions on fear effects. Also you are immune to fear. Remember that this is a supernatural effect and won't work inside an antimagic field or similar places. Immunity to fear effects is a very nice ability to have, however the aura effect isn't so good, although the bonus is morale.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Divine Health (Ex): </b>Become immune to all diseases. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: purple;">Turn Undead</span> (Su): </b>At 4th level you gain turn undead. This is a very important ability and its main purpose is powering divine feats. A big problem is that since you lack the ability to turn undead prior to level 4, you won't be able to take divine feats, probably until level 6 when you get the next open feat. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Spells</span>: </b>You prepare spells and your casting is wisdom based. You are not going to use save or die spells, so a 14 wisdom score should be fine. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Special Mount (Sp): </b>You gain a special mount that is stronger and tougher than normal animals of its kind. For more information see the special mount entry.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Remove Disease (Sp): </b>1/week and an additional time per week for every three levels after 6th, you gain the ability to remove disease, as per the spell.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Code of Conduct</span>:</b> A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin’s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There are also variant paladin classes of different alignments from Unearthed Arcana:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Paladin of Freedom:</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As standard paladin except:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Class Skills:</b> Replace diplomacy with bluff. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Aura of Resolve</span> (Su): </b>You are immune to compulsions and give a bonus to compulsion effects to allies close to you. Immunity to compulsions is probably better than immunity to fear, as it's probably easier to come by. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Spellcasting: </b>You gain the spells: protection from law, magic circle against law, remove curse, dispel law, freedom of movement. You lose: death ward, discern lies, dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, protection from chaos. Freedom of movement is a good spell to have, but so is death ward. The other spell swaps are not that important.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Code of Conduct</span>:</b> A paladin of freedom must be of chaotic good alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin of freedom's code requires that he respect individual liberty, help those in need (provided they do not use the help for lawful or evil ends), and punish those who threaten or curtail personal liberty.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Paladin of Slaughter:</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As standard paladin except:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Class Skills</span>: </b>Replace diplomacy with intimidate. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Aura of Evil (Ex):</b> The power of your aura is equal to the paladin of slaughter level. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Detect Good (Sp): </b>At will you can detect good, as per the spell. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Smite Good (Su): </b>Identical to smite evil, only that works on good creatures. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Deadly Touch (Su): </b>Identical to lay on hands, but it deals damage and heals undead.

Not only it is subject to a saving throw, the difficulty classes for subsequent saves are all very low for high levels. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Spellcasting: </b>Replace the standard paladin's spell list with the following spell list: 1st—bane, cause fear, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from good, protection from law, read magic, resistance, virtue; 2nd—bull's strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle's splendor, inflict moderate wounds, owl's wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment; 3rd—blindness/deafness, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount, prayer, inflict serious wounds, magic circle against good/law; 4th—break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel good, dispel law, inflict critical wounds, poison, unholy sword. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Code of Conduct</span>: </b>A paladin of slaughter must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of slaughter's code requires that she disrespect all authority figures who have not proven their physical superiority to her, refuse help to those in need, and sow destruction and death at all opportunities.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Paladin of Tyranny:</b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As standard paladin except:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Aura of Evil (Ex):</b> The power of your aura is equal to the paladin of slaughter level. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Detect Good (Sp):</b> At will you can detect good, as per the spell. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Smite Good (Su):</b> Identical to smite evil, only that works on good creatures. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Deadly Touch (Su): </b>Identical to lay on hands, but it deals damage and heals undead.

Most DMs ban this outright. Paladins have a special mount and unless they swap that class feature for an alternative one, they are already looking at -2 points, however, since your leadership score is the sum of your level and your charisma modifier and you're able to receive most positive modifiers to your score just by doing your job right (great renown - fairness and generosity), raising your score high enough to effectivelly get another player character under your control will be extremely easy. Don't forget about followers, too - they can also be used, even though their combat effectiveness will be limited (you'll require resources to keep them around with you and they're too weak to survive direct confortation), unless the situation is a siege of your personal keep, where they will mostly be using ranged weapons. To optimize the Leadership feat even more, you can check out Heroes of Battle, which features some feats that can boost several aspects of the leadership feat (<i>Extra Followers, Improved Cohort, Practiced Cohort, Inspirational Leadership</i>).

Remember that if you're planning to use it, it has a spellcraft skill requirement of 4 ranks, which is a cross-class skill for the paladin class.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Goad[Retrain]&nbsp;<sup>CV</sup>:</b> <strike>Great for charismatic front liners. You can attract an enemy and survive since paladins are usually nice tanks, but also save a weak opponent</strike>. This feat is not that great, because it has multiple restrictions and only prohibits melee attacks on your teammates. However, it's a great feat for your starting levels and you can opt to retrain it later; this is because it will start to lose effectiveness as you'll start encountering enemies with different movement modes than land speed - for instance any flying creature is difficult to goad, unless you also possess a flying speed or the creature has a large threat range. The controversial thing with this feat is that it is based more on your opponent, than on you (except from the DC of course), because it relies on his or her threat range. This feat is very good against opponents with weak will saves that either have large reach or require mobility to be effective (e.g. chargers); in addition, assuming that your opponent is only dangerous with his melee attacks, you can use this to save a weaker ally, by forcing the enemy attack you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Winter's Champion</span> <sup>FrB</sup>: </b>You add the spells from cold and winter domains to your class spell list. The spells are unimpressive and mostly deal direct damage.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Draconic Aura</span> <sup>DrM</sup>:</b> <strike>Project a draconic aura. This is very useful and flavors with the auras/buffing effects the paladin already has</strike>. Indeed, this is very good feat and fits the class thematically, assuming you've got the [dragonblood] subtype. The best thing is that this feat provides a great deal of versatility: you've got a wide selection of auras to choose from and most will benefit all the members of a party. Obviously you should check with your teammates and choose an aura that boosts the party's most important abilities. The <i>Energy </i>aura is very good to help a primary spellcaster that employs spells of a particular energy type - e.g. a spellcaster that specializes in cold using the Snowcasting feat - that way you can provide him with a pretty good bonus to his difficulty class. Note that the same applies to any ability that has the appropriate descriptor or deals damage of the chosen type, so, for example, it might help a Dragonfire Adept, too; the <i>Insight </i>aura will be mostly useless - the only use I can think of that will benefit a party is if most of your allies grab the Knowledge Devotion feat; if your party features more than one offensive spellcasters, then they will probably love the free Spell Penetration feat(s) provided by the <i>Power </i>aura; <i>Presense </i>boosts the social skills Bluff, Diplomacy and Intimidate - while these skills are all worthwhile, unless your party uses the demoralize combat action, it's not worth it to boost them via an aura; the&nbsp;<i>Resistance&nbsp;</i>aura is good for the first levels - a party that will crusade against pyromaniacs will gladly get the extra protection, but after some levels the energy protection will quickly lose effectiveness; <i>Resolve </i>helps against fear, paralysis, sleep effects and concentration checks, but it doesn't boost any other saving throws - you're already immune to fear, you give a +4 morale bonus to your teammates and getting a +4 max bonus on saves versus paralysis and sleep effects, while useful, isn't good enough; <i>Senses </i>is probably the best non-specialist (that is, if you exclude situations that another aura is more useful, because of your party composition) aura you can pretty much acquire - at the end you're essentially giving everyone a little more than three bonus feats (Improved Initiative, Skill Focus[Spot], Skill Focus[Listen]). Having good spot and listen checks is fine, but the important thing here is the initiative bonus; i don't really like the&nbsp;<i>Stamina </i>aura, but the bonus to fortitude saves is well worth it; <i>Swiftness </i>is another great choice for parties that value mobility (or lack in that sense) - the skill boni are good, but getting +10ft movement speed to <u>all</u>&nbsp;movement modes at an early level (7<sup>th</sup>) to all of your party members for just one feat is heavenly; and finally, the&nbsp;<i>Toughness </i>aura is obviously not worth it, since it can be easily bypassed by magic weapons.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Daunting Presence[Retrain]&nbsp;<sup>LM</sup>: </b><strike>A charisma based will save feat that can make opponents shaken</strike>. Since most paladins will not have the Intimidate skill as a class skill, if your party employs demoralize/fear tactics and you want to participate, then this feat will make it happen. Note that this has to be used as an opening or finishing move versus an opponent - it makes people shaken, but it has no effect if a creature is already shaken; it arguably works versus targets that are frightened (since shaken + shaken = frightened, your target is no longer shaken), so, for instance, you can open with daunting presence, have someone make your target shaken again and then use your daunting presence once again to make him panicked. Daunting presense has a charisma-based difficulty class and scales as you level up, because it's based on your hit dice; moreover it's a ranged ability - you don't have to be threatening the enemy with your weapons, just to have a staredown contest! As you gain levels, if your enemies are frequently immune to fear or mind-affecting effects, or you just have better things to spend your standard action on, you can just retrain it.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Avenging Strike <sup>ToB</sup>: </b><strike>Unless if you are going to deal with creatures who possess the evil subtype, take this. Otherwise it's not worth it. Note that this works if the outsider has the evil subtype, regardless of alignment (it means that you can avenging strike paladin outsiders for example that have the evil subtype)</strike>. Avenging strike is a very elegant feat that would probably be a very popular choice among those builds that favor charisma synergies, but, unfortunately, it can only be used on specific creatures - those outsiders with the [Evil] subtype. Since it requires you to have a good alignment, that probably means that you're thinking of a build featuring the traditional paladin class, so you will almost definitely encounter evil outsiders at some point in the campaign, but whether they will be enough to justify you picking this feat is debatable. Check with your DM - if you're going to delve into the Abyss or Nine Hells, then it's a quite good pick; otherwise it's better to pass on it. Another little detail: it probably is a typo, but, as written, if you use a swift action to empower your attacks, that energy lasts until your next attack - it doesn't have a duration (like 1 round), so you can probably prebuff your weapon with it (although it <u>will</u> be&nbsp;discharged on your next attack, whether you hit an outsider with the [Evil] subtype or not) so that you can use your swift action on something else. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Dilate Aura</span> <sup>FCII</sup>: </b>Double your aura's range once per encounter for rounds equal to your charisma modifier. <strike>Mediocre</strike>. Indeed, it's not an ability to die for, but I wanted to note that a paladin with many followers from the <i>Leadership</i> feat will probably make the best use of this feat. Too bad that as written you can only enlarge only one of your auras. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: purple;">Sword of the Arcane Order</span> <sup>CoV</sup>: </b><strike>This is a gem. One of the best feats for paladins out there</strike>. To elaborate on this beautiful feat: it enables you to memorize sorcerer/wizard spells in your paladin slots, using your own spellbook or a borrowed one; in addition your wizard caster level is treated as the sum of your wizard, paladin and ranger levels. So, to list the disadvantages, since the advantages are pretty obvious: you can't dump Intelligence, as you'll need it in order to cast wizard spells through this feat; since you're not going to have a really high intelligence modifier or the ability to use high level spells, you're restricted almost exclusively to buffs; you're restricted to specific deities (Azuth or Mystra), even though that's not really a problem, since Mystra's order, Knights of the Mystic Fire, features some sweet substitution levels; it is unclear whether you can have a spellbook without levels in the wizard (or wu jen) class - if you can only get your own spellbook by dipping those classes, you can either choose to dip or invest in <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/spellcraft.htm">spellcraft</a>&nbsp;and use borrowed spellbooks - be warned that the spellcraft DCs to memorize spells from borrowed spellbooks are quite high, at 15+spell level; the way that the caster level calculation for wizards is worded, seems to debuff caster level and to always set it at wizard + ranger + paladin levels, making feats like <i>Practiced Spellcaster </i>worthless - it wouldn't be that way if the ability was just "you add your paladin and ranger levels to your wizard caster level" - I don't think this is RAI, though, and it will rarely matter, since you'll need to dip 4 levels in the Paladin class anyway. An issue you'd most probably like to clear with your DM is whether the spells you cast using this feat are arcane or divine. In the case they are arcane, you'd have the additional restriction that they are subject to arcane spell failure, but you'll be able to qualify for prestige classes, feats, abilities or items that require you to be able to cast arcane spells and activate eternal wands. In the case they are divine, they are not subject to arcane spell failure, but you'll be able to use them in conjunction with abilities that only work on divine spells (for instance the <i>Divine Metamagic </i>feat, check <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786932724/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786932724&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">Complete Divine</a></i>'s errata)&nbsp;and create scrolls of arcane spells that are treated as divine spells (your <i>Archivist</i>&nbsp;party member will love you).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">From Smite to Song</span> <sup>CoV</sup>: </b>Spend a smite attempt to activate a inspire courage effect with effective bard level equal to your paladin level. <strike>Average feat</strike>. I used to think that, but actually this feat has a number of uses. First of all inspire courage is one of the best bard songs and the most common target of optimization (boosting its bonuses via feats and items); you only spend a feat to get the best class feature of a class and it automatically scales, too! The downside is that it scales according to your paladin level, which is not that good, because you'll normally want to prestige out as quickly as possible. In addition, it requires you to worsip Milil, a deity that offers some interesting substitution levels; if you get the first level of Harmonious Knight, you'll be able to get this feat from your first level (as it requires 3 ranks of perform and the substitution level makes perform a class skill for you).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: purple;">Battle Blessing</span> <sup>CC</sup>:</b> <strike>A gem. Auto quicken nearly everything on your spell list. A must if you are going to value spellcasting</strike>. In truth Battle Blessing does not affect nearly everything on your spell list, but over 100 paladin spells benefit from it. Since this feat only works with paladin spells, you'll most probably have to stay in the class, or choose prestige classes that advance spellcasting; this is actually a negative, but you can work something out by selecting alternative class features and abilities that depend on your paladin level (for instance the <i>From Smite to Song </i>feat, or the&nbsp;<i>Charging Smite </i>alternative class feature). What Battle Blessing does for your combat buffs is invaluable - it can be used on helpful combat spells such as&nbsp;<i><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/divineFavor.htm">Divine Favor</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/bullsStrength.htm">Bull's Strength</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/holySword.htm">Holy Sword</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magicCircleAgainstEvil.htm">Magic Circle against Evil</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/protectionFromEvil.htm">Protection from Evil</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/shieldOther.htm">Shield Other</a>&nbsp;</i>and you are free to full attack or even employ another buff (assuming it originaly had a casting time of 1 round, since you only have one swift action per round, normally).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Dreadful Wrath</span>&nbsp;<sup><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786931345/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786931345&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">PGtF</a></sup>:</b>&nbsp;This is a very good feat for every charismatic character.

It's obviously a good feat for your starting levels and if you get enough smite attempts to use per day, you can retrain it for something better.

Also useful if you have also other kinds of smite</strike>. Indeed, this is an option if you have problems with damage reduction, but the paladin class is feat-starved, so it's better that you let your equipment take care of it; fortunately you're getting a mild damage boost to your smite attacks, but unless you've got a lot of them, don't bother with this feat; it's only worth taking if you've got a large amount of smite attempts per day and if they are 'special', meaning that they're not aligned, but affect something else, for instance, the smite the Killoren race gets.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Exalted Smite</span> <sup>BoED</sup>: </b>This is worthless.

This feat is so bad, that even against fire based creatures - that is creatures that have the [Fire] subtype - can be worthless, as it adds just elemental damage, easily negated by spells and abilities. On the plus side, you do get a bonus smite attempt and you can convert other smites (but only from character levels or cleric domains, so Killorens are out) to "smite fiery foe"s, but unless you're convinced that you're going to be constantly battling creatures with the [Fire] subtype at relatively early levels, better stay away from this one.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ranged Smite Evil <sup>BoED</sup>: </b>You can use a smite evil attempt through a ranged weapon. Great if you want to play a ranged paladin. The other alternative, is using the elf paladin substitution levels, but obviously that option has two main drawbacks: you've got to be an elf and the weapon selection to deliver smite evil attacks is restricted to longbows and shortbows (with their composite versions), however, it doesn't eat up a feat. Both versions share the same drawback: you can only smite evil with them and you can't use other smite types.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Smiting Power <sup>CoV</sup>: </b>Smiting power is not very powerful, but it can be used as a connection between your innate paladin powers and special combat maneuvers, should you decide to use them. Between the overrun and the bull rush maneuver, the latter is easier to optimize without sacrificing too much of the resources available to you; selecting some feats (Knockback <sup>RoS</sup>, Jotunbrud <sup>RoF</sup>, etc) or items (Brutal Surge enhancement <sup>MIC</sup>) or even the Dungeoncrusher Fighter variant (just a 2 level dip is required), will greatly increase your bull rushing capabilities and Smiting power will add charisma synergy to the mix.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Awesome Smite</span> <sup>CC</sup>:</b> <strike>Ignore some damage reduction points, trip opponents or ignore miss chances against opponents you smite. Great maneuvers</strike>. This feat enables you to use three maneuvers; each of which requires that you make a smite attack while using the <i><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#powerAttack">Power Attack</a></i>&nbsp;feat (minimum attack penalty -1). As written, this feat enables you to use the maneuvers, whether your target is valid for your smite type or not. <i>Demolishing Smite</i> will easily cut through any damage reduction - it ignores damage reduction points up to twice your charisma modifier, which, will easily be 6+; <i>Overwhelming Smite</i>&nbsp;is a weird one - if you hit and deal damage with your attack you can treat your attack as though it was a trip maneuver; if you get your hands on <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#improvedTrip"><i>Improved Trip</i></a>&nbsp;somehow, you immediately gain another attack against your opponent! So it's like using a smite attempt to gain a free attack (other certain conditions of course, but it can work) - however note that tripping is not always effective (e.g. against flyers); finally, <i>Seeking Smite </i>will enable your attack to negate any miss chance your opponent might have, which is very useful against many buffs (<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/displacement.htm"><i>Displacement</i></a> for instance).</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Divine:</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Divine Cleansing <sup>CW</sup>:</b> The bonus is limited to +2 and it's only for fortitude saving throws.

This provides even more charisma synergy. Great feat</strike>. Just to note that Divine Might increases your charisma synergy, but you will be able to use it less than 10 times per day, unless your charisma modifier is really high and you don't have to spend turn attempts to power other divine feats. Obviously, since divine might affects appies to the attacks that you make in a full round, to get the most out of this feat you need to get more attacks per round; however, the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#twoWeaponFighting"><i>Two Weapon Fighting</i></a>&nbsp;feat line is out, as it requires a lot of dexterity investment on your part, which, as a Paladin, is not a good option. A great solution to get more attacks per round is to acquire secondary natural weapons, such as claws, tail, bite, etc - you will attack with a big penalty (-5 modifier to attacks), but that applies only to your secondary natural weapons - not your original attack sequence. Another note is that if you want to play a Paladin that utilizes ranged weapons (maybe using the elven substitution levels), Divine Might applies to all weapon damage, not just melee ones! Of course, to qualify for it you need to have<i> <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#powerAttack">Power Attack</a></i>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Divine Resistance</span> <sup>CW</sup>: </b>All allies in a 60ft burst gain resistance 5 to cold, fire and electricity.

This is another feat that will enhance your charisma synergy. Unlike Divine Might, Divine Shield has a scaling duration, which increases according to your character level; this enables you to save some turn attempts to fuel other divine feats, as you won't have to activate it each round. The bad news is that you'll have to spend the first round of combat to power up your shield, as activating Divine Shield takes a standard action. If you somehow manage to squeeze two fighter feats in your build (possibly dipping into fighter or psychic warrior) you can grab Shield Specialization <sup>PHB II</sup> and Shield Ward <sup>PHB II</sup>; the first is rather uninteresting and dull - it just increases your shield AC by one point with the selected shield group (light, heavy or buckler), but it grants you access to the second feat, which will let you add your shield bonus to AC (remember that figure is enhanced by Diving Shield) to your touch AC and checks or rolls to resist attack options like bull rush, disarm, grapple, trip or overrun.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Divine Vigor </b><sup style="font-weight: bold;">CW</sup><b>: </b><strike>If you are wearing heavy armor, your speed will be greatly reduced. This not only pumps your speed, but also provides you with 2 temporary hit points/level. The effect has a duration of minutes/level. Great feat</strike>. Actually the feat is good, but the activation is not; if you're going to spend a round buffing, you are not going to do it for some temporary hit points and bonuses to speed; this is only useful if you know that you are going to face an enemy within minutes, which makes it a luxury feat.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sacred Vengeance <sup>CW</sup>: </b>If you want to hurt undead more, you can purchase an undead bane weapon for the same effect 24/7.

The main problem is that paladins do not have many spells that are worth it to be made persistent; the most common choices are <i>Bless, Divine Favor, Blessed Aim, Divine Sacrifice, Strength of Stone, Find the Gap, Prayer, Sacred Haven, Blessing of the Righteous</i>. If you are allowed to persist wizard spells by using the <i>Sword of Arcane Order </i>feat, then a whole lot of options open up for you - for instance using the <i>Thunderlance </i>spell which creates a lance of force with great reach made out of pure force, which will let you attack and deal damage using your charisma instead of your strength modifier.

Unfortunately this is worthless, as it requires a divine caster level of 5, which you won't possess at early levels - skip it.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Divine Justice[Retrain]&nbsp;<sup>PHB II</sup>: </b>This is interesting if you are a purely defensive character without large damage outputs. Targeting rogues or melee skirmishers can give you large amounts of damage easily. Also there are effects that diminish damage after it is dealt (fortification armor negates critical hits, damage reduction, fast healing, general healing). This is a perfect feat for your early levels if for whatever reason your damage output lacks (for instance, you might be a member of a small-sized race, a halfling or a gnome, so early levels will be kinda difficult to get by) and you consistently deal with single 'bosh'-type enemies; you can retrain it later for something more useful.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Divine Ward <sup>PHB II</sup>:</b> This is more important to clerics than you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Profane Aura</span> <sup>PHB II</sup>: </b><strike>Nice ability to battlefield control a bit, but a two-bladed knife</strike>.

Actually, it is bad, even for clerics; to make the best out of it you need healing spells that allow you to roll a high number of dice and paladins do not have spells like that.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Sacred Purification</span> <sup>PHB II</sup>: </b>This requires sacred healing.

Actually, this is a lot like <i>Divine Cleansing</i>, if you count that all those saving throw bonuses are fortitude based, except fear. It also debuffs your enemies' saves against fear effects, but for the level you are going to get it, expending a standard action for a minor penalty (-2) is just bad. Only consider it if you are in a party that uses stacking fear effects and even then, only as a luxury (or thematically 'correct') feat.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Divine Censure</span> <sup>FCII</sup>: </b><strike>Spend a turn attempt to shaken all evil outsiders within 30ft. The ability lasts for charisma modifier rounds and has a charisma based difficulty class</strike>; even though this feat has charisma synergy, it's too specific to be of use.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Divine Defiance </span><sup>FCII</sup>:</b> <strike>This isn't useful to you. It screams cleric</strike>. To be more specific, you just won't have enough spells prepared for this feat to be useful, while a spellcaster with access to turn undead (typically clerics) will have a greater variety of spells prepared and, thus, a larger chance to counter a spell.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Divine Justice</span> <sup>FCII</sup>: </b><strike>This is actually nice. "Evil outsiders" covers a lot of creatures and you get to shaken them, too</strike>. Actually "evil outsiders" covers a lot of creatures, but unless you're going to campaign against devils or demons or yogoloths, this feat will not very useful. Besides, if you count the shaken effect out, the damage is not that great - 2d6 averages at 7 points of damage, which you can get with <i>Divine Power </i>if you have a high enough charisma modifier.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Persistent Refusal <sup>FCII</sup>:</b> Your saves are already very high.

It's like a better version of <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/rogue.htm#specialAbilities" style="font-style: italic;">Slippery Mind</a>, but it requires the expenditure of a turn attempt in order to work.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pious Defiance <sup>FCII</sup>: </b><strike>I prefer divine fortune that covers all your saving throws</strike>. <i>Divine Fortune </i>requires a high caster level, thus, you won't be able to pick it up at early levels; still this fact does not make this feat any better - it scales with levels, but it only help your will saving throw.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Retrieve Spell</span> <sup>CC</sup>: </b><strike>This is nice especially with things like sword of the arcane order and the like</strike>. Unfortunately no. <i>Retreive Spell </i>requires you to already possess two divine feats in order to acquire it, so you can use it to regain some combat spells, but it takes a big toll&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Spiritual Counter </span><sup>CC</sup>: </b>Too many turn attempts needed.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Class Stacking:</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ascetic Knight</b> <sup style="font-weight: bold;">CV</sup><b>:</b> Monk and paladin levels stack for unarmed strike and smite evil damage. Obviously, the main purpose of this feat is to dip into the monk class for 1-2 levels and then use <i>Ascetic Knight </i>to benefit from the increased damage, possibly by getting feats, items and abilities that further increase your base unarmed strike damage. If you're looking to make the best out of the monk dip, take a look at the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/variantCharacterClasses.htm#overwhelmingAttack">Overwhelming Attack</a> variant monk from <i>Unearthed Arcana</i>, which can set up a charging base for <i>Shock Trooper </i>and similar feats, the <i>Feign Death </i>or <i>Invisible Fist </i>or <i>Spell Reflection </i>alternative class features&nbsp;if you're looking for ways to get rid of your <i>Evasion </i>ability, the <i>Decisive Strike </i>variant that replaces <i>Flurry of Blows </i>with something that's more useful (you can also combine it with <i>Scorpion Kama </i>from <i>Magic Item Compendium</i>). If you're playing in Eberron, you can also trade your 2<sup>nd</sup> level bonus feat for the <i>Whirling Steel Strike </i>feat, which lets you treat the longsword as a special monk weapon.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: red;"><b>Devoted Inquisitor </b></span><b><sup>CV</sup>: </b><strike>Smite evil and sneak attack to potentially daze a foe. Mediocre</strike>. Actually not a lot of things are immune to being dazed and this ability scales according to your hit dice and your charisma modifier; unfortunately, you have to find a sneak attackable evil creature and use both of the special attacks in a single blow in order just to qualify to activate this ability. Still, some builds, for instance, a <i>Shadowbane Inquisitor </i>build, could find it to be a great addition to their arsenal.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Devoted Performer <sup>CV</sup>:</b> Paladin and bard levels stack for determining smite evil damage and number of bardic music/day. Unfortunately your bard songs do not get stronger by this feat alone, so you should also consider coupling this feat with <i>Initiate of Milil </i>which does exactly that: stacks your paladin, bard and cleric levels to determine how powerful your bard songs are.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Devoted Tracker </span><sup>CV</sup>: </b>Paladin and ranger levels stack for determining your wild empathy bonus and smite evil bonus damage. Also you can designate your special mount as your animal companion and gain both benefits. This is the base feat that is used in builds that are generally referenced as "supermount" or "ubermount"; this is because, by stacking the benefits of an animal companion (generally the one gained from the <i>Ranger </i>class won't do the trick - the animal companion gained by the <i>Beastmaster </i><sup>CV</sup> is used instead) and your special mount. The <i>Halfling Outrider </i><sup>CW</sup>&nbsp;and the <i>Wild Plains Outrider </i><sup>CV</sup>&nbsp;classes are used to continue advancing both your animal companion and special mount features and gain an extremelly powerful mount - it's possible to have a companion with more than 20 hit dice if <i>Unearthed Arcana </i>bloodlines get into the mixture. You can add feats like <i>Exalted Companion </i><sup>BoED</sup>or <i>Dragon Steed </i><sup>DrN</sup> for some additional special mount options.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Exalted:</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Gift of Grace <sup>BoED</sup>: </b>Share with your companions some of your divine grace.

Unfortunately it requires weapon focus. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sanctify Weapon <sup>BoED</sup>:</b> When you cast sanctify weapon, it also becomes sanctified.

However since you will focus on high AC it will pretty difficult to disrupt your spell even then</strike>. That is true, but even then, most of your combat spells will be swift action buffs, which you don't have to use concentration for, anyway. Invest in this only if you want to meet a certain requirement - many feats and prestige classes require concentration ranks.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Craft: </b><strike>This is a skill for peasants, not charismatic leaders</strike>! Actually, the craft skill is more useful than I thought it would be. First of all, you can cut down on costs for armor and weapons, which requires pretty low difficulty checks. Then, since you're able to cast spells you can actually make alchemical items, too. Investing many ranks beyond those required for making some standard equipment is not recommended though, since intelligence is a dump skill for this class.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Diplomacy</span>:</b> I'd max out this one. It gives you a lot of social interaction choices and with your high charisma you should be the party's face. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Handle Animal:</b> <strike>I'd skip this one unless you would like to act as an animal tamer. There's no reason to spend more than a few ranks in this skill (in order to qualify maybe for requirements)</strike>. There's no reason to not be an animal tamer - with a mild investment in the handle animal skill you can generate some really powerful allies, especially early on in your career, that can serve you as mounts, too, if you chose to swap your own for something else.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Heal:</b> <strike>Great skill to stop your fallen allies from dying</strike>. I wouldn't bother investing more than a few ranks, just to be able to make the check if need be. Some feats that have a healing theme require a few ranks in this skill.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Knowledge (Nobility and Royalty):</b> Get this at least to five ranks to gain the synergy bonus on diplomacy checks. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Knowledge (Religion)</span>: </b><strike>Spend five ranks in this skill so that you get the synergy bonus, which is great for any character who turns Undead</strike>. Synergy bonuses are great, but don't expect that you'll be turning or rebuking Undead creatures effectively, unless you choose to spend some cash on equipment that will enable you to do so. This is still ranked blue however, because it's your one and only skill that identifies creatures, which is important, especially if no one in the party can act as a monster identifier.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Profession</span>: </b><strike>Again this isn't a skill for a legendary commander</strike>. Actually not that true; there are several good choices here that fit thematically with the paladin class, for instance, you could be a captain, so it'd be great if you also had some profession(sailor) ranks; profession(sailor) by the way is one of the rare professions that also have a mechanical aspect - some spells from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786937025/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786937025&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20"><i>Spell Compendium</i></a>&nbsp;use profession(sailor) and it's useful if you're in a naval adventure. This skill is still ranked red, because it's more of a issue related to your character's theme, rather than optimizing your character.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ride:</b> Max this if you plan on acquiring the mounted combat feats. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sense Motive:</b> Spend some ranks in this one. It can be used to identify the intents of NPCs you might come across and also has various social uses.

Bluff is a nice skill. Spend at least 5 ranks in bluff as it gives synergy bonuses to four different skills. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Paladin of Slaughter: </b>As with standard paladin but diplomacy is replaced with intimidate. Since you have a strong charisma, you can use intimidate to optimize stacking of fear effects.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dragonborn Paladin: </b>As with standard paladin but add knowledge (arcana) to class skills. I wouldn't bother with knowledges except if you need them for requirements. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Half-Orc Paladin: </b>As with standard paladin but replace diplomacy with intimidate. Since you do this replacement only on the substitution levels, you won't have enough ranks to do a huge difference, but the investiture is worth it. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Elf Paladin: </b>As with standard paladin but add survival to class skills. Don't bother.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Planar Paladin: </b>As with standard paladin but add knowledge (The planes) to class skills. I wouldn't bother with this type of knowledge. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Crescent Moon Knight: </b>As with standard paladin but add knowledge (local-impiltur) to class skills. Insignificant. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Holy Judge: </b>As with standard paladin but add knowledge (The planes) to class skills. I wouldn't bother with this type of knowledge. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Lion Legionnaire: </b>As with standard paladin but add knowledge (nature) to class skills. Leave this to more wilderness related characters. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mystic Fire Knight: </b>As with standard paladin but add knowledge (arcana) and spellcraft to class skills. Spend some ranks in spellcraft in order to get practiced spellcaster. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Noble Heart: </b>As with standard paladin but add survival to class skills. Can't make a huge difference. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ruby Rose Knight:</b> As with standard paladin but add bluff and perform to class skills. This are nice skills to spend ranks, but the substitution levels suck.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Red Falcon: </b>As with standard paladin but add knowledge (history) to class skills. Only useful if you have levels in bard.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Wary Swordknight: </b>As with standard paladin but add listen and spot to class skills. Nice if you need to pay more attention to your surroundings. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Harmonious Knight: </b>As with standard paladin but add perform to class skills. Again this is a nice skill, but the substitution levels are below average. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Shadow Cloak Knight:</b> As with standard paladin but add hide and move silently to class skills. You already get bonuses to these skills for being a gnome and the substitution levels are great. Since you gain hide in plain sight, consider spending some points in these skills.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">and finally you can replace some of the skills through Skilled City Dweller:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Replace handle animal with gather information</span>: </b>This is a useful trade. Gather information will see a lot more play from your part than handle animal. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Replace ride with tumble</span>: </b>Not so useful unless you give up your special mount. Even then, you will be wearing heavy armor and dumping dexterity, so don't expect much from this. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Replace Knowledge (nature) with Knowledge (local): </b>Knowledge (nature) is gained through substitution levels. You may want to replace it to fulfill requirements. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Replace survival with sense motive</span>: </b>This is obviously a bad trade since you already have sense motive as a class skill.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Skill Tricks:</span></b></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dismount Attack:</b> If you succeed in a fast dismount attack, you can attack an adjacent opponent as if you have charged him.

Bards boost your reflex and will saves and give you access to arcane spells. Thus you can activate bardic wands and eternal wands. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: purple;">Cleric</span>:</b> Probably one level of cleric is the single most powerful dip of all. Gives you turn undead earlier so you can acquire feats quickly. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: red;">Fighter</span>: </b>Sure, bonus feats are nice, but fighter levels hurt too much in paladin builds: Spells, caster level, class skills (although you do get intimidate in return), smite evil progression, turn undead, lay on hands, special mount. I don't think that getting one or two feats in return is worth it. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Monk: </b>All good saves, but lots of monk abilities work only in light or no armor. One possibility is Ascetic Knight, taking one or two levels in monk and getting high unarmed strike damage. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1 level:</b> Improved Unarmed Strike, Stunning Fist. I wouldn't take improved grapple as a paladin, stunning fist has some synergy with high wisdom. Also its difficulty class is based on character level. Also trade flurry of blows for Decisive Strike, a PHB II alternative class feature which unlike flurry, works in armor. </div></blockquote><blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>2nd level: </b>Evasion, which works in light armor, so you should wear the best mithral medium armor (breastplate probably) and a bonus feat to either combat reflexes or Deflect Arrows. Don't take this level if your fighting style isn't two-handed. Deflect arrows which is the natural choice, works only if you have a free arm, which isn't the case with shield/sword. Also evasion is more limiting than helpful (since it limits your armor and you have to beef up your reflex saves).</div></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ranger: </b>If you are taking this consider it closely. All stats will be important to you, will no exception. Devoted Tracker will stack paladin and ranger levels, resulting in powerful mounts. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sorcerer:</b> Charisma synergy, but gish builds with paladin levels, aren't actually paladin builds. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Wizard: </b>Great with sword of the arcane order.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hexblade (CW): </b>Charisma synergy and will save boost. Curses won't see much play, but arcane resistance, mettle and the variant feature dark companion are nice. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Marshal (Miniatures Handbook): </b>The minor auras use charisma modifier for the bonus they provide. This is great for field leaders.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="font-size: large;">Prestige Classes:</span></b><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></b> <b><span style="color: purple;">Emissary of Barachiel</span> <sup><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786931361/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786931361&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">BoED</a></sup>: </b>The bad news are that the <i>Words of Creation </i>feat from the same book, is listed as a requirement; that feat is awesome, especially for bards, but it unfortunately requires you to have a score of 15 in your intelligence and a <i>base </i>will saving throw of +5, so dipping is almost certainly guaranteed in order to get in the class early. Fortunately, Emissaries of Barachiel do not have other difficult entry requirements to meet - only Diplomacy at 8 ranks (you should actually max diplomacy out with this class) and another, rather useless feat. What you're getting from this prestige class is just a single ability, called Calling, which is usable once per day per class level, just like bardic music; actually the whole class is probably intended for bard class. This ability is a powerful one, or should I say a <i>game-breaking </i>one, so, if you don't want books thrown at you, you'd better seriously consider taking this class beforehand. What makes this ability so good is that the saving throw difficulty class to resist the ability's effects is a skill check - more specifically you Diplomacy skill check (if you scroll back to the skills section you'll find out that Paladins have two skills that give synergy bonuses to diplomacy and that a single level dip in the Marshal class from the sourcebook <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786932813/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786932813&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">Miniatures Handbook</a>&nbsp;</i>not only gives you +2 to your base will saving throw and the <i>Motivate Charisma </i>minor aura, but also a free <i>Skill Focus</i>[<i>Diplomacy</i>]!). And one would thought that if you have such a high-DC ability, well, the effect would be either too specific or too limited; well, you can use it to buff allies and debuff enemies, by applying them different conditions, based on their alignment. Those conditions are: Inspired, Blessed, Enthralled, Disheartened, Stunned and Demoralized, but the ability does not have a single target - it instead affects anyone within 30ft of you; yes, that's right - you can have inspired allies (+2 morale bonus to pretty much every roll for 10 minutes) and Stunned (1 round) AND Demoralized &nbsp;(-2 to pretty much every roll for 10 minutes) by spending just one of the Calling ability. Wait, the list does not end here, when you reach level 3 you're able to freakin slowly convert creatures to lawful good - fortunately the Calling ability is [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]. On top of that, the class gives you more skill points that the paladin class and even has Use Magic Device as a class skill; plus you get the ability to cast charisma-based spontaneous divine spells.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><b><span style="color: purple;">Fist of Raziel</span> <sup><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786931361/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0786931361&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dictmortshand-20">BoED</a></sup>: </b>This prestige class does not have the power to end campaigns like Emissary of Barachiel, but it does have very strong special abilities. First of all, you do get a permanent <i>Magic Circle against Evil</i>, which helps a lot versus summoned creatures and mind control, while giving you additional defenses against evil creatures, which are obviously your natural enemies, being lawful good. The prestige class features a lot of improvements to the smite evil attacks and it even offers more smite attempts per day and at a faster rate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Blackguard (DMG):</b> poison use, sneak attack, Dark Blessing, but requires cleave and five ranks in hide to enter.

Continues special mount progression. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Halfling Ourider (CW): </b>Another prestige class for special mount. This is actually better than cavalier but you need to be a halfling.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hunter of the Dead (CW):</b> Easy requirements. Great against undead. If you are in an undead heavy campaign, this is a nice choice. Unfortunately, even though hunter of the dead gives several turn undead features, such as divine feat-like abilities, it hasn't turn undead progression, so that means that you would probably use turn attempts to power divine feats and abilities. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b><span style="color: blue;">Knight of the Chalice</span> (CW): </b>This is a very good class. Grants various immunities to you and allies, a turn undead feature that works against evil outsiders and some nice spells that aren't on the paladin's spell list.
