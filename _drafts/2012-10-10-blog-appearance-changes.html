I decided to change the layout a bit, to make the blog more readable. I used 'soft' colors, that I personally prefer as a background when reading large blocks of text; additionally I changed the fonts, because the original ones felt too generic.  <br />I'll be formatting the guides with css (headers and lists), so until I'm finished you'll probably get weird layouts on most of the guides; that's actually normal (or isn't it :P?), mainly because the posts' HTML is a mess; blogger's editor is cool and all, but to achieve better (and accurate) results you'll have to directly edit the HTML code yourself.  <br />I'd like you to comment if you see something wrong in your browser (you might be missing a font and seeing things differently), or if you've got a problem with the colors, especially if it's related to my color coding pattern (red-[font's default color]-blue-purple) - like if it's difficult to see what an item's color code is.
