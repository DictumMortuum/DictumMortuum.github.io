<div id="page-wrap"><div class="info-col"> <h1>Cleric Dipping Guide</h1> <p id="catpicker"><a href="#" id="allcat" class="curr">All</a> | <a href="#" id="red" class="filter">Bad</a> | <a href="#" id="black" class="filter">Average</a> | <a href="#" id="blue" class="filter">Good</a> | <a href="#" id="navy" class="filter">Perfect</a></p> <p>The cleric is one of the most powerful casters in the game, but also has a very interesting feature: most of the class features are gained at the very first level! Since getting a single level will provide you with a multitude of abilities, the class has value as a full caster, but also as a dip. <br />For those who are not familiar with the term dip, it refers to clever multiclassing into classes that offer a lot of benefits with just a few levels (like one or two). Generally martial characters do dips while spellcasters benefit more from keeping their spellcasting levels up. <br />When dipping, try to remember: <br />1) Don't do it if it destroys an important aspect of your character. That is if you play a skill monkey and dip into fighter for the feats, it's not going to benefit your role. If you play a spellcaster dipping into the same class to gain fighting abilities is counter intuitive. <br />2) Aim for classes that have low entry requirements. This applies mostly to prestige classes, but base classes have their entry-like requirements or side effects, such as paladin, which requires you to follow a code of ethics and be lawful good. While that isn't good enough to undermine your character, just think of all those good sorcerer spells (in the case of a paladin/sorcerer) you are not be able to use.<br />The original idea for this guide is not mine; credits go to <a href="http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75882/19862462/CO_Project:_Dipping_Guide!?post_num=5#338131598">ChristopherGroves</a>.  </p> <h3>Advantages:</h3>   <p><b>Saves:</b> Dipping cleric will increase the most important (arguably) saves, fort & will, by two points. <br /><b>Domains:</b> Domains offer spells and special abilities; obviously, the spells will not have a big impact, as you'll get only one, but the domain granted powers are usually good, especially if you choose a deity with the domains it offers in mind. It's true however that there are many domains with worthless granted powers, mostly because they benefit from multiple cleric levels. With the introduction of the sourcebook <i>Complete Champion</i>, you can also swap worthless (to you) domain granted powers for [Domain] feats, which, most of the times are a lot better and are dependend on level and turn attempts.<br /><b>Turn Undead:</b> Clerics get turn undead from level one and [Divine] feats are powered from turn attempt uses. Unfortunately that's the only way that turn undead will be useful: powering [Divine] feats; you're not going to be having undead minions or turning them away, unless you find a way to buff your turning level, not an easy feat with just one level in the cleric class. <br /><b>Magic:</b> You're getting a lot more than just 1<sup>st</sup> level spells; you also get the ability to activate magic items like wands and staffs, with no need for you to make Use Magic Device checks.  </p> <h3>Disadvantages:</h3> <p><b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Clerics have 3/4 base attack bonus, so dipping for a level is going to lose you one point of base attack. That means that you'll get an additional attack due to high BAB a level late. Also, keep track of prestige classes, because warrior prestige classes often have a BAB requirement.  <br /><b>Experience Penalties:</b> Not much to talk about here; for my group it was never an issue and we never used the ruling, but if you go exactly by the book, keep an eye: either get a race with favored class: any or cleric, or keep dipping to other classes to a minimum.  </p> <dl> <h3>Important Domain Powers</h3> <div class="colorcode red"><dt>Destruction <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd>You get the ability to smite; you might want the ability to qualify for a prestige class; in that case, this is a cheap way of getting the ability to smite, in addition with other bonuses. The ability's damage scales according to your cleric levels, so unless you absolutely need this ability to qualify for something to further your build, don't get it for any other reason.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Knowledge <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd>Grants all knowledge skills as a class skills to the cleric class; this is a good dip if you want to save some skill points to avoid purchasing knowledges as a cross-class skill. Do note that the cleric class has knowledge[arcana] and knowledge[religion] as class skills already and you can swap this domain power for the feat <i>Knowledge Devotion</i> from <div class="book">Complete Champion</div>, which grants an additional knowledge skill as a class skill and helps you a bit in combat.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode blue"><dt>Luck <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd>Generally speaking, the ability to reroll in a game that involves heavy use of dice is a good thing. From a statistical aspect, no matter your classes and abilities (at least, most of the times), you are bound to roll bad, or critical miss, which is even worse. Granted, the chance is minimal, but rerolls, like the granted power of this domain, makes the chance even lower. This is a very good ability, even if it's only once per day, because it applies to virtually every roll you can make.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Magic <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd>Or the domain to pick if there's an item crafter in your team; with a single level you're able to activate almost every single spell trigger or spell completion magic item in the game, since the cleric and wizard spell lists are the broadest of them all. Your wizard (and probably cleric) caster level is going to be very low, so you're not getting the maximum efficiency out of staffs, but wands and other similar devices (e.g. schemas) are good to go.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>Travel <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd>The travel granted power grants a very important ability: freedom of movement. The number of effects that you can resist with this ability is quite a lot and many of them are important (for instance, grapple or paralysis). The bad news is that you can use this ability for a number of rounds equal to 1 round per cleric level, which will be significantly low. Still, even for once per day, given that its free action activation, it is a good pick for any martial character. <br />The domain power also grants the skill <i>Survival</i> as a cleric class skill, so you can utilize this power to save some skill points, like in the case of Knowledge domain's granted power. <br />It must be mentioned that a lot of builds (especially swift hunters) will also benefit greatly by swapping this power for the [Domain] feat: swift action movement helps move through the battlefield and deliver full-attacks whenever possible.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode red"><dt>Trickery <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd>The only purpose of this power is to get some skills as class skills to qualify for a prestige class. It's only mentioned here because it adds three skills to the cleric's class skill list, which is the highest amount, next to Knowledge domain's all knowledges. Only dip to get this domain power if you don't want to invest in intelligence (and increase multiple attribute dependency) or spend a feat to get these skills.</dd></div> <div class="colorcode black"><dt>War <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd>Netting more than one bonus feat would probably rank domain powers at blue rating, but these two, <i>Martial Weapon Proficiency</i> and <i>Weapon Focus</i> are unfortunately not the cream of the crop. I can't think of a martial build that would benefit greatly by dipping in the cleric class in order to get martial weapon proficiencies, but the weapon focus feat can be handy to complete requirements. <br />A questionable tactic including this domain power would be worshipping a deity that favors an exotic weapon; it is still unclear whether you receive an exotic weapon proficiency or not, so it depends a lot on your DM. This last trick also works very good with the <i>Warblade</i> class from <div class="book">Tome of Battle</div>, since you can adapt the feats to any other weapon you want to. </dd></div> <div class="colorcode red"><dt>Combat Casting <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd></dd></div> <div class="colorcode red"><dt>Combat Casting <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd></dd></div> <div class="colorcode red"><dt>Combat Casting <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd></dd></div> <div class="colorcode red"><dt>Combat Casting <div class="book">Player's Handbook</div></dt><dd></dd></div></div> </dl> </div>
