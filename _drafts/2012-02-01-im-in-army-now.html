For those of you that haven't read the shameless <a href="http://dictummortuum.blogspot.com/p/give-me-money.html">Give me Money!</a> page, I've been enlisted and I will be there for several months (serving in the army is an obligation for all males here in Greece). For the first few months my access to the internet will be scarce. I hope I'll have the chance to clear my head and continue updating handbooks as soon as possible, but, all projects are considered on hold until further notice.
