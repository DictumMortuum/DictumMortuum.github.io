Hello to everyone. I finally have a stable internet connection as I've got an office 'job' (they don't pay me :P) in the greek army. Expect updates and revisions soon on many of the guides.<br /><br />Today I've been pondering on different builds using the interesting Court Herald class from Power of Faerun. The class has been pretty much under the radar, even though it's very interesting. It has steep skill requirements, so I went on a quest to get the best possible combination of base and prestige classes to be used as an entry.<br /><br />At that point I thought that I've done the same thing so many times - checking if a particular class or classes have a certain skill or skills as class skills. So I thought: this process can be automated, at least at a certain level: if we had a database containing information on each class (and prestige class) and provided a set of requirements, it'd not be difficult to create a set of possible class combinations that could cover those requirements.<br /><br />If anyone knows whether this kind of thing has already been done, please let me know! In the case that this hasn't been done, anyone willing to help me compile information (so many books of classes/prestige classes!) or knows of a clever way to organize the database scheme in this particular case (each class has more than one levels, should there be one record per class or multiple? - I'm leaning towards the latter, using another table and foreign keys), it's appreciated!
