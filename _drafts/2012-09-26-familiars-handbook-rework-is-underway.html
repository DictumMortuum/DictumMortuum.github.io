I've been busy lately, so I didn't have much updates - most where edits here and there.<br /><br />I'm very happy to announce that I started working on the familiars' handbook. It's quite possibly my favorite handbook thus far and I want to give it the proper attention. It will feature a list of all possible familiar options, color-ranked, but it's possible that I will pay special attention to those that really matter - like imps, mephits, coure eladrins and the rest exalted familiar options.<br /><br />It will also list the possibilities of turning your familiar into a spellcaster, besides using wands and UMD.<br /><br />Stay tuned.
