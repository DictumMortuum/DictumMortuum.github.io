I'll try to cover everything in as comprehensive a fashion as possible, but since I'm not just copying the handbook the process will probably take a while. The thread will be mostly practical optimization so all the advice presented will be aimed with campaigns and playability in mind; records are one thing, but practically being able to shoot 40000' away isn't going to come up very often in campaigns. I will cover the tricks to pump one's range, but I won't be making builds with the sole intention of shooting damn far.&lt;br /&gt;–Eldariel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I am editing and completing this handbook as of November 2017.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Solo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Ratings&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Source Legend &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;General&lt;br /&gt;Overview of Archery Styles:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traditional Archery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crossbow Archery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mounted Archery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Class Specifics:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Martial Archers [Fighters, Rangers et co.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Skirmish Archers [Scouts, Swift Hunters et co.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Precision Archers [Rogues, Ninjas, et co.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Sublime Way Archers [Tome of Battle]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Incarnum Archers [Magic of Incarnum]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Factotum Archers [Manyshot Builds]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Divine Archers [Cleric, Archivist et co.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Arcane Archers [Gish, Arcane Archer et co.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Inspiring Archers [Bards]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Psionic Archers [Ardents, Psychic Warriors et co.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Shapechanging Archers [Druids et co.]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Ratings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Red &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;options are rated as bad, and should by and large be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Black&lt;/b&gt;

Archery is easiest divided to range categories:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Point Blank Range&lt;/span&gt; [Up to 30']&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the range for Point Blank Shot, Manyshot and the range limitation for most sorts of Precision Damage. The common Swift Hunter Archer is going to want to visit this range quite often and this is also the range for a normal Rogue to Sneak Attack. This is also the standard move action, so acting at this range is almost as dangerous as fighting in melee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extended Point Blank Range  [Up to 60']&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the range for Precision Damage Dealers with range extending feats, such as a Swift Hunter with Ranged Skirmisher. If you can move after attack, this range gives you relative safety and alpha strike capability as an average movement speed of 30' cannot charge beyond 60'. This is generally also the maximum range you'll have to deal with in dungeons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Long Range&lt;/span&gt; [Up to ~300']&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is generally one-two increments away and a range where normal characters can still succeed their spot checks, so a good range to start an encounter at for a non-Precision Damage Archer in wilderness areas. At this range, you can generally pepper the opponent with a few full attacks before they close in to casting/melee range and free damage never hurt anyone. Most Cleric Archers and other non-Fighter Archers tend to operate at this range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Extreme Range&lt;/span&gt; [~300' upwards]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To effectively act at such a range, you tend to need uncanny means of detecting opponents, be it ridiculously high spot check or some divination magic/spotter, and very high attack bonuses or long range increments to act effectively. A Fighter Archer with Ranged Weapon Mastery, Dragonbone Bow, Far Shot/Distance-weapon and levels in Cragtop Archer can probably still act effectively given the means to detect opponents, but usually it already starts to take effort and specialization to function at such a range. High attack bonuses help too, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for a breakdown for the class specifics: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Swift Hunter-section will obviously be for the short ranges. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sneak Attacking Archers mostly deal with Extended Point Blank Range. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A majority of the guide will deal with Long Range (all non-Precision characters). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At least the martial section will be touching upon Archers geared for Extreme Ranges (due to terrain and spot difficulties, such ranges are usually impractical so it's not the primary focus).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;The Archer as a Combatant&lt;/h3&gt;The largest challenge an archer tends to face is damage. Since archers generally key their damage off a different attribute than their To Hit, they can't solely focus on one or the other, and since Power Attack hasn't been printed within 3.5 rules for ranged weapons (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a298/animefunkmaster/EnergyBow.jpg&quot;&gt;Hank's Energy Bow&lt;/a&gt; though, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deadly-aim-combat/&quot;&gt;Deadly Aim&lt;/a&gt; feat and the Peerless Archer prestige class), archers tend to have a lot of difficulty dealing damage comparable to effective melee combatants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since archery generally doesn't lend itself very well to controlling the battlefield, most archers should focus on dealing enough damage to warrant their position in the party. Of course, depending on the class, the archer will fill secondary functions like the Divine Caster, the Skill Monkey, the Arcane Caster or such, but if you want to do archery, you should do it well enough to actually make shooting arrows worth your time. This means that dealing damage is an important hurdle to overcome. The specific means for pumping up damage will be covered separately in each section, and this is indeed the main point that requires optimization when it comes to archery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage archers have, of course, is functioning at a range. Archers can easily guarantee full attacks simply because it doesn't really matter where the opponent is as long as you have line of effect; and few creatures are able to retaliate from 1000' away so there's something to be said about nuking someone in the horizon. Archers have lots of options that only work at short ranges which of course sucks far as utilizing their biggest advantage goes; as such, anything that requires being within 30' of opponent should be considered twice, and likewise ways to extend your operational range if you have such limitations should be a high priority so that you're more than just a sub-par pseudo-melee damage dealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archery has a few more ways to generate extra attacks than melee making effects that can be applied on each hit comparatively more worthwhile to an archer than to a melee type. This is important especially with feats, spells &amp;amp; class features granting flat damage bonuses and with magic weapons. Archers benefit of those comparatively more than most other types of warriors. The magic weapon benefits are further expanded by the option of placing separate, situational enhancements on arrows/bolts at a low price and being able to whip them out when you actually face opponents vulnerable to those Bane-arrows you bought or whatever; most efficient way of using opposition-specific weapon enhancements in the game, really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;Regardless of what kind of archery you're going for, it will be feat intensive. It's almost as bad as Two-Weapon Fighting in that regard, and that's saying a lot. This especially hurts otherwise solid archery-classes like Cleric that would want to pick up other feats too, but are generally spending 3+ feats on archery just to get the basic archery ability. Beyond the base 3 feats, archers can pick up a lot of useful abilities through extra feats, and thus archery lends itself pretty well to feat heavy classes – a 2-level Fighter dip is often solid for non-spellcasting builds. In this chapter, I'll break the feats down by Archery Archetype since I cannot really do that in the other sections; Archery Archetypes kind of supersede the exact build.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Archery Feats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;Point Blank Shot [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#pointBlankSho&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – No prerequisites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feat sucks, but it's a prerequisite for practically everything archery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precise Shot [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#preciseShot&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Point Blank Shot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without this, you'll be peppering your allies in melee or alternatively cannot use archery as your main tactic after the combat is joined. This is also a requirement to utilize the best equipment-based buff for archery, Splitting [CoR Pg. 42], so if you've got access to Splitting, this is an absolute must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Sharp-Shooting&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;[CWar, Pg. 105] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feat has very few uses; mostly it's just one of those &quot;My Fighter had too many feats and doesn't qualify for Improved Precise Shot yet so he picked this to be retrained later&quot;-feats, and quite frankly, optimized Fighters don't have too many feats. So what it does – it halves the AC-bonus standard cover gives opponents. That's it. It doesn't help against opponents behind a tree, with concealment and it doesn't even remove the Cover-bonus.You're still better off looking for clear shots than shooting through cover, so effectively you spent a feat to make an unfavorable situation slightly less unfavorable, but still one you don't want to be in. Congratulations. Oh yeah, and this doesn't help the standard problem of not dealing sufficient damage at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improved Precise Shot [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#improvedPreciseShot&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Dex 19, Precise Shot, Point Blank Shot, BAB +12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hitting into Grapple is handy, although by the time you get this, you'll mostly have Freedom of Movement available anyways along with swift action teleportation, so this ability won't be as helpful as it could possibly be earlier. Much more important though is the ability to ignore all but total concealment and cover. This opens up some interesting uses with some spells (basically anything that grants lesser degrees of concealment) and items such as Eversmoking Bottle, causing one-sided miss chance. It's also fun to be able to shoot through that keyhole with 100% accuracy. Overall, a handy feat if not &quot;OMG MUST HAVE&quot;-material. Steep requirements though; not available to Zen Archers and +12 BAB means it comes very late for everyone. It's the Be All-End All feat for hitting though, ignoring just about any obstacles but solid walls and complete darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woodland Archer [RotW Pg. 154] – Requires Point Blank Shot, +6 BAB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tactical feat is handy for snipers, but the true power is the first ability for the volley archers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjust for Range: Volley archers love this one; the more attacks, the better. The volley types with maximized number of attacks can often be hitting ACs over 100 easily towards the last ~10 shots or so, so it's solid 400-500 damage to opponents at AC 100. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pierce the Foliage: The second option allows ignoring all concealment including total concealment giving you a strong tool against invisibility and similar abilities, while also making up for Improved Precise Shot for those builds that can't afford picking up Improved Precise Shot, and for those looking to pick it up later &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moving Sniper: Finally, the third option is great for snipers; being able to move while sniping makes it easier to avoid being located, and also to keep the distance you want between shots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far Shot [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#farShot&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Point Blank Shot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to shoot further than everyone else. Frankly, it isn't worth a feat as such long-range combat isn't all that commonplace and you can gain this ability magically (through the Distance-enhancement on arrows) for when you need to shoot at faraway targets. This isn't worth a feat (except for qualifying purposes), but this does warrant inclusion on a bunch of arrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Zen Archery&lt;/span&gt; [CW Pg. 106] – Requires Wis 13, BAB +1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are making a Wisdom-based character dumping Dex, this is a must. It's the Weapon Finesse of Ranged Weapons. Clerics, Druids and generally Wisdom-based casters are the most likely subjects, although some martial Wisdom-based classes might also end up in a situation where this is optimal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Deadly Aim&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#deadly-aim&quot;&gt;PF SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Dex 13, BAB +1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically Ranged Power Attack; PF Power Attack, but still Power Attack. Of course, the catch is it's from Pathfinder, not actual 3.X. Still, anyone building an Archer would do well to at least ask if this were available; PF material is backwards compatible and this gives archers something they sorely need. There's a ton of ways to buff ranged To Hit but 3.X offers literally no efficient ways of converting all the extra To Hit to damage, and no efficient means of buffing damage only in general. If you can, take this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clustered Shots [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/clustered-shots-combat/&quot;&gt;PF SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Pathfinder feat, this one allows you to use a full-attack action to total all the damage you inflict on a target before damage reduction is applied. Handy if you don't happen to have a Force arrow handy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranged Disarm [CW Pg. 103] – Requires Dex 15, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to make Disarm-attempts with ranged weapons at the range of 30'. Unfortunately, the limit of point blank range makes it much worse than just using a two-handed weapon such as Spiked Chain, giving you bonuses to the Disarm-attempt. Further, Disarming is a rather weak strategy in the first place due to the existence of items such as Locked Gauntlets making it just useless, and the fact that many monsters fight with natural weapons, which aren't very disarmable. Extra options are nice, but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disarming isn't usually worth the trouble. Still, seeing that we're talking about an opposed attack roll here, I could see some implications in some campaigns. Generally you just won't have the feats to burn though. Note that this feat gains &lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt; benefit of the Improved Disarm-feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranged Sunder [CW Pg. 104] – Requires Str 13, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to make Sunder-attempts with ranged weapons at the range of 30'. Again, it's annoying to only be able to use it at point blank range, and further annoying that Piercing Ranged Weapons only deal ½ damage even with this feat. Serpenttongue Arrows could help there though. I could definitely see implications for this feat, but often you don't want to Sunder opponent's weapons simply because they're loot. Still, it also works against objects, and it can be handy in arena settings so I wouldn't consider it entirely useless. Generally you can't afford the feat for this though. Note that this feat &lt;b&gt;isn't&lt;/b&gt; helped by Improved Sunder-feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranged Pin [CW Pg. 103] – Requires Dex 15, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite of the three; this allows you to make ranged Grapple-checks. You need to beat opponent's AC, and then you get to make Grapple-checks provided that opponent is close to a surface (such as the floor when flying overhead). If you do manage to win the Grapple-check, they are considered Grappled until they succeed DC 15 Strength- or Escape Artist-check as a Standard Action. Therefore, they'll at least waste a turn, and it requires no actions whatsoever from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quite handy for archers focusing on Strength for damage (as while you don't get Improved Grapple-benefits, Strength-modifier and Size-modifier apply as normal), giving you extra tools against certain archetypes (such as an easy way to keep casters in AMF; Arcane Archer shooting an AMF with Imbue Arrow, using the arrow to Grapple the target would pretty much one-hit KO a caster at any range). This really works the better, the bigger you are as the bonuses are hard to come by. Overall though, there are many implications for this – very handy to keep Melee away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sense Weakness [Drac Pg. 106] – Requires Int 13, Combat Expertise, Weapon Focus (any)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When attacking with the weapon you have Weapon Focus in, you can ignore up to 5 points of Damage Reduction. While this annoyingly requires Combat Expertise that is rather wasted for you, this is one of the few mundane means of fighting Damage Reduction with a bow. And Damage Reduction is a huge hurdle for an archer whose damage tends to be based on a large number of attacks. In an environment without Force, or other magical ways to ignore DR, I'd definitely strongly consider this if I had the feats to burn (and was going for Ranged Weapon Mastery anyways; that basically gets you Weapon Focus for free).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead Eye [DC Pg. 95, DR304 Pg. 84] – Requires Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus, BAB +14 (DR304 is Dex 13, BAB +1)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This adds Dexterity to your damage within 30' as precision damage. Dragon Magazine #304 only had Dex 13 and BAB +1 requirement, which obviously made the feat much better. As it stands, it's quite situational; while your Dex is probably massive and thus the damage bonus is massive, the limitation in the range and the fact that many enemies are probably immune and there are no easy ways to bypass these immunities, unlike with Sneak Attack or Skirmish, makes it far less amazing than it would be otherwise. It's worth considering but if you can get the damage from more reliable sources, do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shot on the Run [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#shotOnTheRun&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Dex 13, Point Blank Shot, Dodge, Mobility, BAB +4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effect is handy... but then you look at the prerequisites! Two useless feats. And what it gets you? You get to move before and after an attack. That means it doesn't work with Order of the Bow Initiate's Precise Shot, Manyshot, Penetrating Shot or really anything else for that matter. Basically, the base idea is good, but the feat has worthless prerequisites and is mistemplated for use with the abilities that could utilize it. Stay away, unless you can talk your DM into allowing Standard Action-effects including Ranged Attack instead of just a Ranged Attack between the movements; Manyshot would be useful with this, but one shot? Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flyby Attack [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsterFeats.htm#flybyAttack&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Fly speed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the feat Shot on the Run, Spring Attack, and company always wanted to be! This is the be-all end-all movement feat, but it requires Fly speed so it isn't available for all PCs. In fact, mostly it's available for Dragonborn, Raptorans and characters picking feats to get Wings (along with possibly casters with magical flight). Though if you can get it with item-based qualifications, give it a good hard look. It enables you to move, Manyshot and retreat in the same round. It also works with Penetrating Shot, spellcasting and so on; basically the perfect tool for getting in range for Precision-attack and getting outside opponent's effective range for your own turn. Skirmisher's feat, though archery is notoriously reliant on its full attacks, and its primary advantage over other combat styles is getting them consistently and reliably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-e0d6f14e-f129-9b08-57ac-5c6667b9ab76&quot; style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;Volley Archery Feats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;Rapid Shot [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#rapidShot&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Requires Dex 13, Point Blank Shot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dex requirement can be problematic for Wisdom-based archers, but that extra attack goes a long way towards making archery worth your time. I'd snag this if at all possible and consider pumping my Dex just to get it. The extra attack is probably going to do more damage on average than an extra point of Strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Improved Rapid Shot [CW Pg. 101] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, Manyshot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Manyshot isn't a very good feat for volley archers (it is occasionally useful though; extra options are always good) and likewise, Manyshotters don't want Improved Rapid Shot. That fact bringing this feat down in value by having a semi-wasted prerequisite either way. Rangers do get Manyshot as a bonus though and Fighters get enough feats to pick it up, and two extra points for hitting is nothing to scoff at, especially on higher levels with a number of iteratives. Not a must have, but handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Knowledge Devotion&lt;/span&gt; [CC Pg. 60] – Requires Knowledge (any): 5 ranks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best feats for boosting the damage output in archery. If you have the feats to burn for Education [ECS Pg. 52, PGtF Pg. 38] along with some skillpoints and Int-modifier, you can cover all Knowledges used for identifying creatures (Arcana, Dungeoneering, Local, Nature, Religion, The Planes) adequately and be the party Knowledge Bank while at it. Even just one rank in all Knowledges gets you at least +1/+1 for all combats with the potential for +2/+2 on decent rolls. Oh yeah, the free Knowledge as a class skill regardless of your multiclassing doesn't hurt either. Pairs well with the Collector of Stories skill trick for a +5 to identifying creatures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Plunging Shot&lt;/span&gt; [RoTW Pg. 152] – Requires Dex 13, Point Blank Shot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get extra 1d6 damage on targets 30' below you. At first glance, this feat appears awesome. Once you start thinking about it though, it appears increasingly bad. First of all, this practically means you'll need to be in the air. 30' is either a cliff overseeing the opponent's position or simply flight and of those, flight should be a more common option. Therefore, it gives you an advantage when you can fly and your opponent can't. Seems good, except if that's the case, your opponent isn't exactly the most dire of threats in the first place, except when talking about another archer. So it's decent in archery duels where you invested in flight and opponent didn't and that's pretty much it. Second, the feat is simply unusable in lots of locales. Good luck getting 30' up in a dungeon. Same goes to pretty much any building. So the feat has a powerful effect, but unfortunately it's way too situational to truly be worth a feat slot in most cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hiding and Sniping Feats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Darkstalker &lt;/span&gt;[LoM Pg. 179] – No prerequisites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're planning on sniping, Hide is your primary tool. Normally this is a poor idea since a vast number of creatures completely ignore Hide with their alternate senses. Darkstalker though means that any creature needs to make Spot-checks vs. you. This is an immense advantage and if you do plan on sniping a lot, this feat is an absolute must. In fact, if you plan on Hiding a lot, this is an absolute must. The only problem is that the source is somewhat obscure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Able Sniper [RotW Pg. 148] – Requires Dex 13, Hide: 5 ranks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get bonuses to hitting flat-footed opponents, and more importantly +4 to Hide-checks made to hide afterward. If you're going Sniping, this is probably the feat to start with; hitting with Snipes and staying hidden go a long way to keeping you alive. There's one unfortunate drawback here, and it's the fact that you only get bonuses to hit against opponents that are at least 30' away. That makes triggering Sneak Attack difficult as you need the opponent at exactly 30' for that, or alternatively you need some way to extend Sneak Attack-range (such as Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77] – as the name suggests though, that's only for crossbow snipers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concealed Ambush [DR339 Pg. 87] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Hide: 10 ranks, Move Silently: 10 ranks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of prerequisites, but you'll have those all as a sniper anyways. This one is quite good. When sniping, you only take -10 on the Hide-check to Hide again. That's effectively +10 to your Hide-checks for this purpose. It's a very limited feat, but if I was making a Sniper, I'd make sure to try hard to fit this if Dragon is allowed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowslinger [Und Pg. 24] – Requires BAB +1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives you +2 on attacks against Flat-Footed opponents. Again handy for making sure you hit, but I don't find this worth a feat; something to pick up with an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/adventuring/actionPoints.htm&quot;&gt;Action Point&lt;/a&gt; when you feel you need the extra accuracy, perhaps. If it helped in Hiding, it could be worth actually picking, but as it stands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penetrating Shot [PHBII Pg. 81] – Requires Str 15, Point Blank Shot, BAB +10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gives you the ability to shoot through opponents in a 60' line as a Standard Action. This could be somewhat useful as since it's a Standard Action, you've got the Move left to Hide with. So this is a bonus to a Sniper, but lined up opponents are relatively rare. Still, it may just be worth it, especially with Woodland Archer to shift position to get the lines right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weapon Enhancement Improving Feats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Mercantile Background&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;[FRCS Pg. 36, PGtF Pg. 41] – 1st Level Only, Location Requirements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feat is a doozy. You get 75% for items you sell and once per month, can purchase something for 75% listed price. Also, you start with extra money – level 1 Composite Longbow with Str Bonus FTW! So yea, this helps you afford a damn good bow. And your party will love you. You can easily be multiple enhancements beyond the normal with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can of course be combined with crafting or other sources of items such as crafting to essentially go infinite as a merchant. Capitalism FTW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Ancestral Relic &lt;/span&gt;[BoED Pg. 39] – Any Good alignment, Character Level 3rd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, this feat allows you to spend items for their full price when enhancing your ancestral relic. In this case, you'll of course want an ancestral weapon. This is a strong alternative to Mercantile Background, but while the feat is not Exalted, it does require Good alignment which is something to keep in mind. There's also a limit on how much you can spend on the feat. Mercantile Background is stronger overall but if you want specifically a stronger weapon, this does have the higher ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Item Familiar&lt;/span&gt; [UA Pg. 170] – Character Level 3rd&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make your Bow your Item Familiar. You'll be able gain a number of free +1-abilities, some Intelligent Item-bonuses or something similar. Further, you'll gain the ability to invest skill points and experience to it for increased returns (although it'll suck royally if it is destroyed – have your contingencies for Disjunction later on). Oh, and you can enhance your bow without actually having Item Creation feats. And you get a free Alertness when wielding the item (That is, all the time! And Spot just happens to be quite the important skill for you!). Probably my favorite of the three, although it really combines well with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the Mercantile Background+Item Familiar-combo, and pull strings for the enchanting, providing the XP myself. That gives me the item for 37.5% of the original price with each item sale providing 25%-units more money. And it's available to any alignment (although Mercantile Background is Faerûn-specific – very easy to convert to any world though (basically, any member of a merchant family would do) – and Item Familiar is from a source you can never assume anything from).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magic Weapon Special Abilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Splitting &lt;/span&gt;(+3 price) [CoR Pg. 42]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so this is the best ability in the books. By far. It requires Precise Shot (just one extra reason to get it) and is a +3 ability, but by gods does it kick ass. Every attack you do hits. Twice. In effect, this doubles your damage output; normal +3 would be about ~+10 damage, this can be around +30 damage easily. Also, getting two attack rolls is incredibly useful for having higher hit percentage and goes perfectly with Woodland Archer [RoTW Pg. 154].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little ambiguity to whether this works with Precision Damage though; it does have two attack rolls which would suggest that it does, but effectively they act as a volley attack, hitting the same place and therefore wouldn't get Precision Damage added. You should check with your DM before getting this for your Precision Damage archer; it's probably still worth it if Precision Damage isn't doubled (since it increases the odds of hitting with it by tons), but that would make it much less good. Personally I wouldn't allow twice the Precision Damage for Splitting since the archer doesn't get to aim the pieces separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explosive (+2 HoB, ammo only; +3 CW) [HoB Pg. 130, CW Pg. 134]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a useful in theory; it allows you to deal area of effect damage with your arrows. It can only be placed on Arrows, though. The downside is that this is very expensive on a ranged weapon and allows a DC 14 non-scaling Reflex-save to halve the damage. This does have a role, but not in normal adventure. The biggest use of this is against armies and craptons of mooks; as such this is better on arrows than a bow, although getting an Explosive Bow for an army fight could be a solid option. The damage is sad for +2 (1d6 = average of 3.5 damage, the average for +1 abilities and this one allows a save) though so this has a very specific application and is going to suck outside that.CW version is a +3 price enhancement dealing 2d4 damage with one point higher Save DC, making it even worse. It can be placed on Bows though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knockback (+3 price) [CW Pg. 135]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This follows the pattern of CW-abilities; it's handy, but kinda expensive for what it does. This can be very useful against medium opponents, but earlier on it's too expensive and later on the guys who want to get close, the Fighters, tend to have enough Strength to win the check even at Medium. Still, getting 5 Bull rushes a turn means you'll win at least some so it isn't totally wasted. Of course it's better in areas where Bull rush naturally works, such as cliffs, areas with lethal terrain, trees, bridges and so on. It isn't going to be a sufficient deterrent to prevent melee warriors from getting to you alone though, so it's definitely something to only get in some Arrows. Still, there are many situations where you can do ugly stuff with this. +3 is a bit expensive though; this would be more interesting at +2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Phasing &lt;/span&gt;(+2 price, ammo only) [DR330 Pg. 67]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phasing ammunition passes through single solid obstacle at most 5' thick (how it interacts with magical barriers like Wall of Force and Prismatic Wall is not mentioned; ask your DM). I seriously don't need to tell you how useful it is to be able to shoot through walls, right? It also passes through shield if there's no cover, or armor if there's no cover or shield, but that's not really of interest here. You obviously buy stacks of these and use them when you need to shoot at someone past a wall. Of course, it's annoying that it's only ammunition but seriously, even if you shoot 50 arrows a turn, getting a bunch of these is worth it for when you're faced with any target behind an obstacle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Force &lt;/span&gt;(+2 price) [MIC Pg. 35]&lt;br /&gt;Archers usually have relatively low damage per arrow. That means Damage Reduction is a real bitch (save for very specific Sniper-builds). Enter Force. This +2 ability allows you to completely ignore Damage Reduction against everything except the Über Epic monster Force Dragon (CR Larger Than You'll Ever Face). Not only that, but it gives you perfect accuracy against Incorporeals and Ethereals. Oh, and since your arrow becomes Force Attack, Windwall – the perennial bane of Archers everywhere – doesn't work against it either. In other words, for a simple +2 ability, you get to ignore three of the biggest thorns Archers face. Thank you sir, may I have another? Even archers with natural abilities to overcome DR will want to consider this. The only reason not to get Force bow is if you already happen to have Energy Bow (or play in a campaign without MIC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Holy &lt;/span&gt;(+2 price) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#holy&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let's face it, most campaigns have evil guys as the prominent enemies. Holy is a +2 ability that works on all of them. And it gives you equivalent to two dice of elemental damage vs. each and every one. Oh, and it makes your weapon good for passing Damage Reduction (and archer can just have arrows/bolts of different materials around to switch as needed essentially allowing you bypass all Good and X-DRs; much easier than trying to have the right melee weapon). Not much to say, if you can afford it, it's one of the best abilities to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Unholy&lt;/span&gt; (+2 price) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#unholy&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the party is evil fighting good guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exit Wounds (+2 price) [CW Pg. 134]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a useful ability. 1d6 damage for +2 isn't horrible, but the real use of this ability is to mimic the feat &quot;Penetrating Shot&quot; [PHBII Pg. 73] without actually taking it. Basically, when opponents line up properly, you could use one of these. Or 5. Two hits is always better than one and if you're a good shooter, you may just make it more than 2. I'd say it's worth keeping some arrows with this around if you can afford them and use them when the chance occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Greater) Dispelling (+1/+2 price) [MIC Pg. 33]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very handy to have in arrows/bolts. If you fight against buffed up opponents or need to end some magic effects or overall need to dispel anything, these are the arrows for the job. The normal ability has a Per Day-restriction, but luckily that doesn't matter on arrows. Great to have in your bag of tools, and quite cheap to boot. Switch to Greater Dispelling when you feel the normal doesn't quite cover it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Magebane &lt;/span&gt;(+1 price) [CA Pg. 143, MIC Pg. 38]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the few Bane-properties worth having (on a bunch of arrows), this works against all things casting arcane spells or have Arcane Spell-Like abilities. In other words, it kicks ass. You could actually put this on your Bow if you face enough casters; +2 to hit/+2d6 damage for +1 ability is immense. Even if you don't, get those damn arrows. One-two stacks to use against Dragons, Liches, Beholders, Wizards and other problematic individuals. Very, very useful and quite possibly the most broad Bane-ability in existence.The MIC version unfortunately doesn't work on creatures with Spell-Like Abilities. The CA-version is much stronger. Still, even the MIC version is worth getting, just not in a weapon, but as arrows. It's still a very broad Bane-ability that works on, among others, Dragons and Liches, two very potent opponent types. Even the MIC version warrants Blue. CA version is more like Royal Blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bane (+1 price) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#bane&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be worth it to keep a few Bane-arrows for more prominent types around. Unlike with normal weapons, due to the fact that a stack of 10 +2 arrows costs basically nothing (~1700gp) compared to midgame wealth, you can afford to keep a few Bane-weapons of appropriate types around. Aberrations are a good bet, as are Undead. Those types cover a wide variety of creatures and should come up often enough. Evil Outsiders, Magical Beasts and Fey are other solid options. Unfortunately Humanoids tend to be too specific, so unless your campaign is overwhelmingly based on one Humanoid-type, I'd steer clear of the Humanoid ones (and if there's such an overwhelming number of type X in campaign, maybe your bow should be Bane X instead of arrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corrosive (+1 price) [MIC Pg. 31]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want elemental damage, Acid is probably least commonly resisted after Sonic (Screaming only deals 1d4, so I'd go with Corrosive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Seeking &lt;/span&gt;(+1 price) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#seeking&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great ability negating all forms of concealment and few specific magical protections. No feat can replicate the reliability of Seeking and indeed, you even negate miss chance for attacking an invisible opponent as long as you get the square right. Absolute godsent at +1 cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Precise (+1 price) [MIC Pg. 40]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replicates the Precise Shot-feat. Basically, if you believe your magical weapon won't get dispelled or sundered, you can use this to save a feat. Note though that it does not actually grant you the Precise Shot-feat so strict reading means it won't work with Splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distance (+1 price) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#distance&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replicates the Far Shot-feat. Definitely something to keep in store (goes especially well with the Swiftwing Arrows [RoTW Pg. 164]); while long range combat isn't all that commonplace, as an archer you better be equipped to fight at that range should the situation require it. The primary selling point of archery over melee combat is the ability to affect opponents you cannot reach; being limited only to Extended Point Blank Range isn't exactly anything a melee warrior couldn't pull off just as well. These arrows are also cheap, so just keep some in storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Collision &lt;/span&gt;(+2 price) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/items/weapons.htm#collision&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This adds +5 to the damage of a weapon. Essentially, you are trading a +2 to hit for +3 to damage, which is a favorable ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-e0d6f14e-f159-152e-6e3b-a277607b1120&quot; style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;Specific Magic Ammunition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;Arrow/Bolt of Biting (Price 506 gp. Cost to create 256 gp) [MIC Pg. 46]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+1 ammo that injects a target hit with an Injury Poison with DC 16 Fort-save for 1d6 Con. Pretty meh, since the Fort-save DC is so low. Actual poisons are generally more effective since they can be crafted for a very reasonable price if you have the skill, and there are ones with actually impressive Save DCs. These aren't completely worthless, but there are generally better ways to spend your money and since the save DC is pretty low, these aren't that useful as backups for particularly tough opponents either (since the tougher the opponent, the less likely these are to work).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fountainhead Arrow/Bolt (Price: 307 gp. Cost to create: 156 gp) [MIC Pg. 52]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A normal ammo that can be shot at a flat surface to create a 10' radius burst Acid-spewing geyser. It acts on your turn and the acid deals 2d8 damage with a DC 14 Reflex for half. It actually isn't horrible since it's guaranteed damage against most creatures and it persists for 3 rounds; it can dig through many materials and the damage can even be useful against creatures if they for a reason or another can't move out of its area easily. And of course, if you happen to find a creature with flat surface to one direction or another, slamming a full flurry of these in its face would be exceedingly efficient; effective 3d8 extra damage (assuming saves succeed) plus the normal attack damage adds up real quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Hellpiercer &lt;/span&gt;(Price: 4007 gp. Cost to create: 2007 gp) [BoED Pg. 115]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a +3 shocking burst ammo that acts as Silver for overcoming DR and delivers a dose of Purified Couatl Venom ravage (DC 16 Injury Ravage for 2d4 and 4d4 Str damage). Price-wise, the arrows are actually cheaper than the ravage but the ravage is so low DC that it's probably not worth it. It works on evil creatures normally immune to poisons, but since the save DC is low, it's unlikely to. Ravages are probably not anyone's favorite thing from 3.5 in any case. Best we just forget about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-e0d6f14e-f15b-cb90-e638-269a20715bb6&quot; style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot;; font-size: 12pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;&quot;&gt;Mundane Weapon Improvements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;Serrenwood (+4000gp) [BoED Pg. 38]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serrenwood is a material. This is a great way of saving money especially if you cannot get a Force-bow. Serrenwood has a set price so it doesn't increase the magical cost of the bow. It's also one of the very few non-Magical ways of affecting incorporeals so even if you get your weapon Dispelled or something, you can still use a Serrenwood bow to drop ghosts (or Wizards with Ghostform; in fights against arcane casters, Serrenwood Bow and overall, all ways of doing magical things in mundane fashion are pure gold).I'd get a bunch of Serrenwood Arrows even if I had a Force-bow for the situations where one needs to hit incorporeal targets without Magic; as an archer you're one of the few possible characters who can pull that off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dwarvencraft (+600 gp) [RoS Pg. 159]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a weapon that's even more masterfully built than a Masterwork weapon. It doesn't enhance the weapon's capabilities, but gives it 2 extra Hardness, 10 extra HP and +2 to its saves. For 600gp, this makes your bow much harder to Sunder, which happens to be a very good thing as losing your primary weapon sucks (although you should keep extra bows in store just in case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Traditional Archery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m1Ak6LO14Uo/WlqUxJfs0WI/AAAAAAAABF4/HABgzaKk6wcFB7IU87AGetT3bARvfx9QgCLcBGAs/s1600/Native%2BArcher.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;838&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1161&quot; height=&quot;459&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m1Ak6LO14Uo/WlqUxJfs0WI/AAAAAAAABF4/HABgzaKk6wcFB7IU87AGetT3bARvfx9QgCLcBGAs/s640/Native%2BArcher.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you want to train a longbowman, start with his grandfather.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;–King Edward II&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;Traditional Archery is the concept I'll be using for the traditional bows: Shortbow, Longbow and Greatbow. This chapter will deal with things applying to all archers using the traditional bows – their equipment, feats, potential downfalls and advantages. These will especially be compared to the other archery styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally this is what's commonly understood to be Archery. If someone says 'archer', people are going to assume a traditional archer as opposed to a crossbow archer, a mounted archer or anything else. This is also the simplest type of Archery to optimize and as a consequence, the vast majority of Archer builds around fall under this category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why choose traditional archery?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;The most important question when making an archer is naturally &quot;Why?&quot; Specifically, why archery instead of another kind of combat style and why make the kind of archer you're making. Traditional Archery has a number of things going on for it, but of course also suffers of some drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick look through the most prominent benefits and drawbacks of conventional archery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can add Strength to damage (thanks to Composite Bows) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No entry feats beyond the core Archery feats needed &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longest range increments in the game (aside from Heavy Crossbow) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No action needed to load the bow  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great for volley attacks &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best support from the official sources (most good Magical Bows are traditional and same goes for special ammo) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can easily use the Manyshot-line of feats for strafing attacks &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can be made Elvencraft to be usable in melee as well as in range &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Dexterity for hitting and Strength for damage, inducing MAD &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tends to rely on volleys, which means poor mobility &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relatively low base damage &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large weapons not fit for concealing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Efficient Pull&lt;/span&gt; [DR350 Pg. 90] – Requires Point Blank Shot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yea, this allows you to treat your strength +2 higher for the purposes of a bow being Mighty. Why does it suck? Well, normal bows don't autoadjust to new Strength. Even if you do manage to get a bow that does, you still only get grand +1 damage for your efforts and a friggin' feat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the damage was +2, this could be remotely considerable, but as it stands, it gives you +2 Strength, not +2 Str-modifier for the purposes of Mighty bows, so you're better off picking useful feats instead. Oh yeah, and this is Dragon Magazine-material, so this usually isn't even available. Maybe that's for the best so new players avoid picking it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Base Weapons&lt;/h4&gt;Longbow (75 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#longbow&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A core NPC weapon, PCs will only use this on the first level if they can't afford a Composite Longbow. A Composite Longbow is better in every respect even if you have absolutely no Strength to add to the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longbow, Composite (100 gp + 100 gp/Strength) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#longbowComposite&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core weapon in Traditional Archery, it's a Martial Weapon so the proficiencies are aplenty, it has a great range, decent damage and falls the in the sweet spot in most ways. You'll always use Composite Longbow over the normal Longbow once you are past level 1 and can afford it, just for the Strength to damage, but also for the extra range. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Composite Longbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longbow, Aquatic (400 gp) [Storm Pg. 107]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This number is the only projectile weapon that can be used underwater without extreme penalties. The range increment underwater is only 10' (on water 60'), but that's quickly fixed by Ranged Weapon Mastery, Far Shot and Dragonbone (and Aquatic Shot [Storm Pg. 93]), giving you a nice 75' range increment underwater; that makes the weapon actually workable there, allowing you to shoot at targets with mere 1-2 increments before you're in melee. Extra benefit of the fact that underwater, cover is very rare so it's relatively easy to gain a real benefit of you range as long as you have means to spot the opponents far away. Unfortunately, there's no such thing as a Composite Aquatic Longbow so you're stuck without your Str modifier. Still, it's better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aquatic Longbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortbow (30 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#shortbow&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shortbow is the worst of the traditional bows available in the game. It has the shortest range, the lowest damage and no redeeming qualities. The only reason to get one is that it costs effectively nothing, being the cheapest traditional bow available by far, costing whopping 45 gp less than the standard Longbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortbow, Composite (75 gp + 75 gp/Strength) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#shortbowComposite&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason to use a Shortbow over a Longbow is that your class only grants you one of the proficiencies. Classes with only Shortbow proficiency include Bards, Rogues and few other skill-based class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Composite Shortbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Shortbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatbow (150 gp) [CW Pg. 154]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get Greatbow proficiency for free and can't afford a Composite Greatbow yet, might as well get one of these. It's strictly worse than the Composite Greatbow, but seeing that the Composite Greatbow is actually quite expensive, costing upwards to 1000 gp without magic, you may use this for a level or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Greatbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatbow, Composite (200 gp + 200 gp/Strength) [CW Pg. 154]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few Fighter-variants get free Exotic Weapon Proficiency, so you might as well pick up Greatbow proficiency for free. Likewise, if you spend a feat on a bow proficiency, you might as well pick the Greatbow for the extra range and damage. Otherwise, the Greatbow usually isn't worth it except when looking to maximize range or when building a Fighter Archer with a limited number of books and running out of damage increasing feats to take; a Greatbow deals an average one point more than Longbow, and the difference increases with size increases (Large difference is 2, Huge is 3, I recall.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Composite Greatbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Double Bow, Elven (1000 gp) [AE Pg. 7]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a strange one. You can spend a Move Action to load up a second arrow and then your next attack is a Volley Attack at -2. You can, if you somehow get extra Move Actions, combine this with a full attack for effectively an extra arrow and it doesn't even punish your entire volley, only the next attack. Of course, the kicker is that there's no Composite version of this listed which means no Strength-bonus to damage. If you get DM to allow Composite versions of these, this might very well be worth the feat. Without Strength-modifier, the extra shot being a Volley Attack and thus applying precision damage only once, it is by and large impractical to use one of these even with something like Belt of Battle [MiC Pg. 73] or Quicksilver Motion [ToB Pg. 65] to gain those Move Actions. Anyone with Longbow proficiency can use one of these as a Longbow, but you need Exotic Weapon Proficiency to use the special features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Footbow &lt;/span&gt;(150 gp + 100 gp/Strength) [RoTW Pg. 164]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this one is a doozy. It's an Exotic Composite Longbow that is designed for use while flying; it takes a -4 penalty when used in ground and can only be used prone. It has the same stats as a Composite Longbow, and is a martial weapon for Raptorans. Why would anyone else use it though? One thing: 1½ Str to damage. That is, a Footbow is kept under feet when flying and you can either fire it with one hand as per normal, having your other free for god knows what, or you can fire it Two-Handed and add 1½ Str to damage. This one is very much worth the effort, if a bit weird weapon to use.If I were a flying archer without much regard for stylistic factors, I'd definitely get me one of these, even at the expense of a feat. This also makes Raptoran Archers a very solid prospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Bow, Yuan-Ti Serpent &lt;/span&gt;(150 gp) [SoX Pg. 137]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exotic weapon that's basically a Longbow and a Short Sword in one. The basic idea is good; you always threaten the area around you and can do ranged attacks without wasting actions switching between the modes. The problem, of course, is that the Elvencraft property can be added to any bow and while with it you are stuck with 20/x2 crits in melee, you also saved a feat on Exotic Weapon Proficiency. Worst of all, there are no Composite Yuan-Ti Serpent Bows to add your Strength to damage; without those it's practically never worth it using one. Elvencraft is just plain better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Mundane Ammunition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Razorfeather Ammunition&lt;/span&gt; (150 gp) [MMV Pg. 169]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren't actually listed being sold anywhere, but by the Craft-rules in PHB, raw materials cost a third of the final result, and Razorfeathers cost 50 gp a piece. The ammunition is considered to be Masterwork, but the book isn't clear as to whether you have to build the Masterwork component separately or if you just work the Feathers and they're automatically considered Masterwork. May be that the actual cost is 156 gp a piece; that's counting the Masterwork cost for each.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, these arrows are awesome. Just completely incredible. First of all, they're mundane weapons that are considered Keen. That's a +1 property almost for free. Second, they're considered Masterwork and Adamantine. That means they're just about the best mundane arrows you can have. It takes a DC 30 Craft (weaponsmithing) check to make 50 of them. You should ask your DM if these are sold in your campaign, and if they aren't, it may be an interesting prospect to go on a Steelwing hunt on Acheron or the Material Plane, and train a bit in the arts of Weaponsmithing (or get help from your friendly neighborhood Wizard with his immense Int-mod).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Alchemist's (1500 gp for 20x) [AE Pg. 5, DR349 Pg. 28]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are basically normal arrows with x2 crit range, except they deal 1d4 fire damage the turn after unless the victim spends a full-round action and makes a DC 15 Reflex-save to extinguish the flames. Very convenient, though somewhat pricy. Extra damage is never a bad thing.The Dragon version is almost worthless, having two categories lower base damage than normal and only 3/4th range increment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Alchemist's Frost (1500 gp for 20x) [DR349 Pg. 28]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrow have two categories lower base damage (1d4 for Longbow) and 3/4th range increment to go with x2 critical rating. On hit, they deal 1d4 extra cold damage immediately, and the arrow shatters. Expensive, though it can be useful against creatures particularly vulnerable to cold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Blunt (1 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows deal Bludgeoning and subdual damage. In other words, these are the perfect tools for taking prisoners, especially when opponent is escaping. As a downside though, many creatures with DR/Bludgeoning also have immunity to subdual damage, so it isn't useful for solving that; you'll still need to default to magical abilities against them. It's worth noting that these aren't metallic to any degree, making them completely able to bypass the pain-of-a-spell Ironguard, which archers otherwise have trouble with. These are cheap, so I'd always keep at least one stack of these with me. Do note that they have a reduced critical multiplier though. These also have halved range increment of the core bow, with any adjustments for Composite Bow added on top of the half (so fired from Longbow, the increment is half of 100' = 50', but from Composite Longbow half of 100' + 10' = 60').&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Dragonsbreath (50 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows have reduced core damage, but deal 1 point of Fire-damage on impact and require a DC 15 Reflex-save or light the opponent ablaze. Certainly handy against Ice monsters, especially Giants and the like. Also good for lighting oil or the like ablaze. These are very useful when used properly, but since they deal reduced damage and have no benefits vs. creatures with fire immunity, I'd still use normal arrows as my normal weapon with these as a special treat for vulnerable opponents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that this is completely nonmagical, and that enough arrows can make anyone roll that 1 for Reflex. Fire is only 1d6 per turn with a new Reflex-save each turn (who the hell thought of that – have people never seen human catch fire and how impossible it is to put out alone?), so it's not that major later on. On earlier levels and against poor Ref-save opponents, it can be handy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Flight (160 gp for 20x) [AE Pg. 5, DR349 Pg. 29]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are normal arrows except with x2 criticals, and they add 25' to the attacks' range increment. Somewhat similar to Swiftwing Arrows in function, but these actually increase your range increments and your maximum range while Swiftwings make it easier to land shots at a longer range, and lose out on base damage instead of critical multiplier. Probably a tool you'll want in your repertoire, though these are fairly expensive like many of these special arrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Hardwood (10 gp for 20x) [DR330 Pg. 92]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These break 25% of the time instead of 50% of the time when missing the target. Yeah, I don't care either. I suppose if you have magical arrows, making them of Hardwood increases the chance of your missed arrows being retrievable. I guess it might save you small amounts of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Pungent (5 gp for 20x) [DR330 Pg. 92]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows deal no damage, but they &quot;paint&quot; the target with a scent helping tracking. There's a +1 on Survival-checks to track hit target, or +4 if the tracker has Scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Serpentstongue (3 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows are used for sundering. Amusingly enough, they deal both, Piercing and Slashing damage. They also deal full damage to objects with hardness less than 5. Again, something to keep around. They also don't have any drawbacks compared to normal arrows besides also dealing Slashing damage so you could actually consider replacing your normal arrows with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Signal (10 gp for 20x) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows deal normal weapon damage at x2 multiplier. They also have -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls making them inconvenient for that purpose. What they are good for though is signalling; they let out a sound resembling the cry of some bird (DC 20 Survival-check allows a listener to determine if the sound came from a bird or another source; DR349 calls for DC 20 Knowledge (Nature) check instead). Elves use these to coordinate their military efforts; your party can do the same. Very simple method of long range communication, and cheap at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Smoking (600 gp for 20x) [DR349 Pg. 29]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows need to be lit to fire them. They leave a trail of thick black smoke behind them and when they land, they act like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#smokestick&quot;&gt;Smokestick&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a 10' cube of smoke in the target square. Good for creating smoke screen especially if you have a Seeking bow. Kind of expensive and the smoke lasts for only a short time, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Star (10 gp for 20x)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows are normal, except they also provide illumination. A Star Arrow provides bright illumination 5' away and shadowy illumination 15' away. Very convenient for hunting in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Swiftwing (20 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are excellent for firing far away; they only suffer half the normal increment penalties. Ask your DM how this interacts with Cragtop Archer's ability doing the same. Anyways, they have one category reduced damage, but they actually make those long shots possible without tons of feats, so I'd definitely have a bunch of these in my Quiver. Especially good for sniping things like Dragons from far away a turn or two before they reach you (once that's taken flight, that is). If you have ~200ft increment, you'd be able to shoot to 1000ft with mere -5 to the roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Thundering (40 gp for 20x) [AE Pg. 5]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows deal no damage instead exploding as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#thunderstone&quot;&gt;Thunderstone&lt;/a&gt; on impact. Basically, they force a DC 15 Fortitude save against being deafened for an hour. These have some niche uses but as they don't deal damage, I don't expect one to use them all that often. Pack a couple with you and when the situation comes up, profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrow, Zigzag (3 gp for 20x) [DR330 Pg. 92]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These arrows take -4 on attacks but deal double damage to objects with Hardness 0. The damage is unfortunately restricted to objects so no hope of double damaging creatures but they're rather convenient in some specific scenarios, like for severing ropes. Given how cheap they are, might as well. These deal Slashing or Piercing damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Magic Weapons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Energy Bow&lt;/span&gt; (22600 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ask/20061227a&quot;&gt;WoTC Site&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best bows in existence. It can shoot Force Arrows for 2d6 damage, it adjusts to user's strength and most importantly, it can be used for Power Shots. Power Shot is an ability that simply doesn't exist in official 3.5 beyond this (3.0 class Peerless Archer has it, and it hasn't been updated so it's legal in 3.5 with all sources though). Power Shot is also one of the easiest ways to overcome the difficulty of dealing damage with bows.Basically, this is a cheap specific bow with two unique abilities. If you can get this and further enchant it (with Splitting), it's easily the best bow in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Bow of the Wintermoon&lt;/span&gt; (3400gp) [MIC Pg. 48]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be mislead by the fact that this is a Relic of Corellon Larethian. Don't worry about the alignment restriction either. What this item is, is a magical base bow with adjusting strength. Regardless of your alignment and the relic status, it's a bow that automatically adjusts to the wielder's strength, and at a very reasonable price. You can add any actual enhancements you want on this hull and you don't need to give a rat's ass about the Relic-powers. For what it's worth, they're pretty awful; you get a +1 enhancement out of being Chaotic Good, Neutral Good or Chaotic Neutral and Frost + Drowbane out of the True Believer or a 5th level spellslot. Given the specificity of both enhancements, it's not really worth your while outside some really heavily Drow-focused campaigns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bowstaff (4600gp) [MIC Pg. 48]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically an Elvencraft Bow that requires a swift action to activate as a magic item. Yeah, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bow of Songs (12330gp) [MIC Pg. 48]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have Bardic Music, the ability to add your Cha to hit&amp;nbsp;and damage for one Bardic Music use is actually kinda good. The only issue with this bow is, it's a swift action to activate and only applies on one attack meaning it's not very useful on full attacks Bards would normally prefer due to Inspire Courage applying to all their attacks. It can be worthwhile on low levels and in some niché cases like some Sniper-build with high Cha, guaranteed crit and high crit modifier on a single attack, but in general, it's at most an extra option for some special circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Oathbow &lt;/span&gt;(25600 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#oathbow&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm just listing this here to tell you not to get it even if you only have access to DMG items. The ability that makes it almost worthwhile is Once per day against one opponent and it sucks against everything else at that point. It's almost decent against BBEG, except +1 Holy bow with Greater Magic Weapon cast on it tends to be just as good against all opponents without any activations, and much easier on the wallet to boot. The only thing good about this bow is that it speaks phrases of Elven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Magical Ammunition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Burrowing Arrow (167 gp) [CW Pg. 135]&lt;br /&gt;This is basically an anti-healing arrow; if target is healed, this deals 1d8 damage and it stops natural healing. This isn't very interesting, overall. The +1d8 damage just isn't that much and natural healing rarely makes a difference in fights. I suppose it might prevent Polymorph healing since that's only a function of the natural healing rate of the polymorphed creature, but ehh... Again, these cost practically nothing in small quantities so I guess you might want to pick one up and in case you come up with a use for it, shoot it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Raptor Arrows&lt;/span&gt; (MIC 6006 gp, CD 14500 gp) [MIC Pg. 56, CD Pg. 93]&lt;br /&gt;This is a Relic of Ehlonna. CD version is almost strictly worse with the difference that it deals 1d8 damage when it lodges itself out of the target. Other than that, CD version only is Bane vs. your Favored Enemies, requires 6th level spell slot and costs over twice as much as the MIC version. MIC is also newer so it takes precedence. Basically, these are Returning Arrows that can't break on shooting and give you +2 to hit and +2+2d6 damage over and beyond any abilities on your Bow against every target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Slaying Arrow&lt;/span&gt; (2282 gp (Greater: 4075 gp)) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#slayingArrow&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;Slaying Arrows are the usual fare far as save-offering magic items go. The save DC is relatively low for the price (20 for normal, 23 for Greater) and thus they're largely impractical. The exception here is, however, that it can affect creatures normally immune to Fortitude-saves, notably Constructs and Undead. Those creatures by and large have horrible Fort-saves so acquiring a Slaying Arrow or two (or Greater varieties) keyed off to Constructs and Undead can be very much worth your while to keep one-two around of when you face an Undead or a Construct particularly problematic to kill in the classic fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sleep Arrow (132 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicWeapons.htm#sleepArrow&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;Par de course arrow that does pretty much what you'd expect: Tries to put people to sleep. Given how many different ways there are to resist this, and the fact that the Will save DC is 11, I wouldn't expect these to work. Not the kind of item I'd be thrilled to buy though they're relatively cheap so it's not a huge deal either way. Low cost, low impact. Oh, and they deal non-lethal damage, though there are cheaper ways of accomplishing that (Blunt Arrows, for one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mundane Weapon Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Dragonbone (+100 gp) [Drac Pg. 117]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dragonbone Bow is the tool for Extreme Range-archers. With mere 100gp extra cost, the bow gets 20ft longer Range Increments. Generally, if you don't get a Serrenwood Bow, you might as well get a Dragonbone Bow. It's very cheap and has a tangible benefit (although the use of extra reach depends on the campaign).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Elvencraft &lt;/span&gt;(+300 gp) [RoTW Pg. 166]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This quality is one of the best things you could ever add to a bow and only costs 300gp. Basically, it makes your Bow double as either a Club (Shortbow) or Quarterstaff (Longbow). Greatbow isn't touched upon in RoTW, but it would probably also be either a Quarterstaff or a Longstaff. This is a great way to fight both, in range and in melee without Quick Draw and to avoid having to cause AoOs by firing bow when threatened. This is also one of the best ways to build a Sublime Way Archer as Elvencraft Bow allows using the martial strikes in melee when need be while still giving you the freedom to fire at will.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Magic Items&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Bracers of Archery, Lesser (5000 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#bracersofArcheryLesser&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;These Bracers give you proficiency with whatever Bow you're wielding. Can be handy for Cleric-types, Rogues et al. to wield Shortbows, Longbows and Greatbows without trouble. If you're already proficient with the bow in question, you get +1 Competence on attack rolls. If you don't have a Cleric or a Bard giving you those Competence-bonuses, it may be worth 5000 gp on midlevels. Mostly these are useful for the proficiency-part though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bracers of Archery, Greater (25000 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/wondrousItems.htm#bracersofArcheryGreater&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;These Bracers likewise give you proficiency with whatever Bow you're wielding. However, the reason they're so much more expensive than Lesser versions is because they grant you +2 Competence to attacks and +1 Competence to damage. If you don't have a buffer giving you these types of bonuses, the Bracers are great since those bonuses stack with everything. Otherwise they're worthless.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Crossbow Archery&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wm6yBJg5uiw/WlqTs5PAw-I/AAAAAAAABFs/ptcULpFyv5I5nJEYe5sw7KDxo8D256TNgCLcBGAs/s1600/Demonhuntress.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;260&quot; data-original-width=&quot;716&quot; height=&quot;232&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wm6yBJg5uiw/WlqTs5PAw-I/AAAAAAAABFs/ptcULpFyv5I5nJEYe5sw7KDxo8D256TNgCLcBGAs/s640/Demonhuntress.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The classics say that the crossbow is fury due to the noise that it makes, and by using the volley fire method, there is no end to the sound and fury, which renders the enemy is unable to approach.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;–Li Quan, Tang Dynasty military official, 759 CE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;Longtime redheaded bastard child of straight bows, Crossbows have two places in the game. First, they're simple ranged weapons for non-martial classes on the first levels when they'd rather stay out of combat and do something when they don't want to expend spells. That's where Crossbows come in handy, as everyone has proficiency, they're cheap and do mean damage on level 1 without any stat dependency. Of course, since reloading them takes a while, they are usually only used few times and before iteratives kick in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At that point, dedicated Crossbow Archers begin to find ways to take advantage of their iteratives, while others move to weapons that don't require quite the commitment. Crossbows are much like straight bows, except they cost you many more feats to use effectively, but offer the option of dual wielding with sufficient magical assistance and feat expenditure. Crossbow Sniper-feat [PHBII, Pg. 77] also gives them solid Single Attribute Dependency with Dex to both, to hit and damage (unfortunately only half to damage though). This allows a Crossbow Archer to operate on a much worse point buy than a traditional Archer. One final advantage Crossbows enjoy is that they can be fired prone, which is very advantageous in ranged combat, although rarely useful in normal adventures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Why choose crossbow archery?&lt;/h3&gt;So why would I make a Crossbow Archer?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crossbows are cheap (thus good for lowlevel play and mooks)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can add Dex to damage (thanks to Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77])&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can be dual wielded (but not reloaded that way without assistance)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heavier Crossbows have great base damage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Normal Crossbows are simple weapons&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can be fired prone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hand Crossbow is easily concealed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can use one-handed, holding a shield, a melee weapon or something else in the other hand (at penalties though)Aquatic Crossbows are probably the best ranged weapons underwater&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feat intensive (I can't emphasize this enough - normal archery feats + crossbow feats + possible Exotic Weapon Proficiencies, TWF, etc. = pain)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heavier Crossbows are very slow to load&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cannot be used for iteratives without trickery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not naturally add any stat to damage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basically require at least one feat to be used with iterative attacksEven less mobile than straight bows (due to move actions being spent on reloading earlier on)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Crossbow Snipe&lt;/span&gt;r [PHBII Pg. 77] - Requires Crossbow Proficiency, Weapon Focus (crossbow), +1 BAB&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get ½ Dex to damage with the Crossbow you have Weapon Focus in. You also gain the ability to Skirmish and Sneak Attack at the range of 60'. Every serious Crossbow Archer should have this, period. This feat singlehandedly makes Crossbows worth using. Without this feat, I probably wouldn't bother with this section at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rapid Reload&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#rapidReload&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] - Requires Crossbow Proficiency&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to actually shoot iteratives with Light and Hand Crossbows. This removes the need for Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Repeating Crossbow as it becomes a free action to load their simple counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Quick Draw&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#quickDraw&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] - Requires +1 BAB&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Draw isn't normally very useful for a Crossbow Archer, but there's one specific benefit; like a Thrower, you can get multiple iteratives with Crossbows by dropping the one you fired and drawing a new one. This allows you to TWF with Crossbows taking full iteratives without actually using any magic or other kinds of cheats. This is a fair-and-honest way of being able to machine gun Crossbows. It's kind of expensive to enhance that many Crossbows though so it gets impractical later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also note that Quick Draw is a prerequisite for the Skill Tricks Hidden Blade (used on your own turn) [CS Pg. 87] and Sudden Draw (used AoO, takes a bit of work to get ranged AoOs) [CS Pg. 89], which allow you to attack opponent with a concealed weapon treating him as flat-footed, so that's an additional use of the feat for Sleight of Hand-using Crossbow Archers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Hand Crossbow Focus &lt;/span&gt;[DoTU Pg. 50] - Requires Hand Crossbow Proficiency, +1 BAB&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feat is Rapid Reload and Weapon Focus: Hand Crossbow in one feat. If you're going for Hand Crossbow focus, this is strictly better than Rapid Reload. Also, the Weapon Focus can lead into Ranged Weapon Mastery [PHBII Pg. 82] for massive damage quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rapid Shot [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#rapidShot&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] - Requires Dex 13, Point Blank Shot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get by the Reload-difficulties Crossbows suffer of, Rapid Shot is just as good for Crossbow Archers as it is for Traditional Archers. Unfortunately, TWFing Crossbow Archers may suffer of piling penalties with Rapid Shot and need to be cautious as to how many extra attacks to take for those penalties.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Base Weapons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Light Crossbow&lt;/span&gt; (35 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowLight&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like Composite Longbow with bows, this hits the sweet spot of Crossbows. You can get Free Action reload, you have decent base damage, only -2 penalty for wielding these one-handed, simple weapon proficiency-wise, the core Crossbow. This is what you should default to in normal sitiuations. Also, since the normal loading is only a Move Action, it's often usable on the first levels since you can effectively spend a Full-Round Action to attack once with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also Two-Weapon Fight with these in a multitude of ways. You can use Gloves of Storing in both hands (or one hand if DM allows switching hands as a free action, which should be possible with Quick Draw) to Free Action-vanish one bow to load the other (likewise a free action), then free action call the vanished weapon, shoot the other, make the one which shot vanish, load the other, etc. allowing you to take full iteratives provided that your DM doesn't put a stop to your Free Action-madness. Ghostly Reload-spell [RoTD Pg. 113] gets you 10 shots of free reloads with both hands too. There's also the weapon ability Quick Loading [MiC Pg. 41], which gives the weapon its own extradimensional space that holds 100 bolts and loads them as a free action for Light Crossbows and Hand Crossbows, likewise allowing you to dual wield Light Crossbows. Bottomline, you can find a way to get two of these go off with iteratives. If nothing else, have a ton of them with Quick Draw and drop the shot ones, drawing a new one for each separate attack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Crossbow, Aquatic &lt;/span&gt;(250 gp) [Storm Pg. 107]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have even the slightest hint of the possibility of going underwater, pick one of these along. It doesn't hurt to have one at all, and this is quite possibly the best underwater weapon in the game. The range increment is 40' (it uses the same 40' increment on land too; quite bad there, but awesome in water). By comparison, Aquatic Longbow shoots at a 10' range underwater, and that's long. Also, since Crossbows don't require Composite construction for any extra damage, you get your ½ Dex to damage as per normal as long as you've got Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, if I was playing in a mostly underwater campaign with a terran race, I'd probably play a Warforged Crossbow Sniper and pick up one of these babies. With Ranged Weapon Mastery and Far Shot, you'll be able to crank the Increment up to 80', and with Gnome Crossbow Sight, you can shoot at 240' without penalties (although DM fiat may make Gnome Crossbow Sight not work underwater). Also, you suffer no damage loss underwater; you're just as effective underneath as you're on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy Crossbow (50 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowHeavy&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy Crossbow obviously hits harder than Light Crossbow. Early on though, it's very hard to use beyond the initial shot due to the fact that it takes a full-round action to load. The average damage drops way under Light Crossbow after turn 1 (Light Crossbow has dealt 9 points while Heavy Crossbow mere 5.5). You do have a Move Action to spare every turn you shoot one of these though. Shooting a Heavy Crossbow in one hand is a -4 penalty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason to use these is the Ghostly Reload-spell, which gives you Free Action-reloading on Heavy Crossbow allowing you to do iteratives with the extra damage. You could also dual wield these, but without very heavy investure of feats and class levels, you'd be taking -6 or worse penalty on all attacks. At this point you'd be better off using Great Crossbow, since it's apparent that Feats Are No Object, and at medium Great Crossbow does whopping 3.5 points more damage than Heavy Crossbow for Exotic Weapon Proficiency-feat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hand Crossbow (100 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowHand&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a whole different ballpark. They serve the same as Light Crossbow in the respect of being able to machine gun either in one hand, or with trickery in two hands. However, what really sets these apart is that a Hand Crossbow is very easy to conceal with Sleight of Hand, giving you tricks you can pull off with the Hidden Blade [CS Pg. 87] and Sudden Draw [CS Pg. 89] skill tricks, as well as to simply take to places where you aren't allowed weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't hurt that even though these are Exotic Weapons, Rogues come with free proficiency in them. There's also the Hand Crossbow-specific feat &quot;Hand Crossbow Focus&quot; [DoTU Pg. 50], which is Rapid Reload and Weapon Focus (Hand Crossbow) in one feat. On their own, these are pretty much Light Crossbows with shorter range and worse damage (no penalties for shooting them in one hand though), but thanks to the support they get from outside sources, Hand Crossbows are respectable weapons on their own right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Great Crossbow&lt;/span&gt; (150 gp) [RoS Pg. 155]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exotic Heavy Crossbow. However, the stats are totally out of whack; the average damage is two categories higher (a total of 3.5 point difference), it has a better threat range, increments are the same. So basically, it's got completely insane damage output compared to Heavy Crossbow and is otherwise the same. If I was making a build focusing on Heavy Crossbows, I'd make it a point to find room for Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Great Crossbow - that is one of those very rare opportunities where a single feat adds over 4 points of damage to every attack you make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same stuff applies to Great Crossbow as to Heavy Crossbow; generally it's profitable with Ghostly Reload enabling iteratives, although some true Sniper-build could also be made with this damage...the weapon is really a portable Ballista.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Crossbow, Repeating&lt;/span&gt; (250 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowRepeating&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weapon is a true turkey. For Exotic Weapon Proficiency, you get Light Crossbow that you can do iteratives with...with clips of 5 bolts! Then you need to use a full-round action to load the damn thing! At the point where you need the iteratives, you'll be spending one turn shooting, other loading. This particular exotic weapon manages to be strictly worse than a simple weapon + a feat. Simple Rapid Reload + Light Crossbow gets you iteratives without limit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last hope dies when you realize that this pile of crap cannot even be loaded without the other hand. So if you dualwield these, they'll be exactly as efficient as simple weapons. Just...don't touch these. Ever. It's quite possibly the worst Exotic Weapon in print. Oh yeah, and it costs like 7 times the price of the simple counterpart and even the bolts manage to be more expensive. It does share proficiency with the usable Repeating Heavy Crossbow though, so it's kind of a free, useless gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy Crossbow, Repeating (400 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowRepeating&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;Unlike its Light counterpart, Repeating Heavy Crossbow actually doesn't suck at everything. This is really the only way outside magic to get iteratives with a Heavy Crossbow. Don't bother loading, just use Quick Draw to draw a second Heavy Crossbow once the first one is empty. You only need one per turn of combat even on later levels, so this should be more affordable than the mass Hand Crossbow/Light Crossbow enhancement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could also dual wield these with the Gloves of Storing-trick, albeit at immense -6 penalties even with Oversized Two-Weapon Fighting [CAdv Pg. 111]. Make no mistake, this one probably isn't worth your time nor the Exotic Weapon Proficiency you spent on it, but it at least has a reason to exist unlike the Light counterpart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Double Crossbow (70 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060420a&quot;&gt;RoTD Web Enhancement&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;These Exotic Weapons are interesting cases with tons of controversial rules about them (mostly just poorly written). You get two attacks at your full attack bonus as a full-round attack if you have the Double Crossbow-proficiency. You can use the two bolts as iteratives if you lack proficiency in Double Crossbow. This raises the question if free action-loading Double Crossbows are effectively Two-Weapon Fighting without the feat (able to take iteratives) and if you can dual wield Double Crossbows, shooting both separately with iteratives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, these require DM fiat to make them interesting; by RAW they can only use the extra bow on the special attack action. If you could combine it with full attack as per Rapid Shot (something the article references, raising a question about the intent here), these might be worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's worth noting that all Double Crossbows have -2 worse penalties for using in one hand compared to normal Crossbows, so Light Double Crossbow's penalty for TWFing is -4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavy Double Crossbow (100 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060420a&quot;&gt;RoTD Web Enhancement&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;Do note that Double Crossbow-proficiency is just one feat; these all share proficiency, just like the Repeating Crossbows. Early on in the game, you could use Heavy Double Crossbow to take double shots at opponent for maximum damage and once you start getting iteratives, switch to Light Double Crossbow to maximize the number of attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These can't be reloaded quickly (save possibly with Ghostly Reload) and have immense penalties for using in one hand, so you probably won't be dual wielding them no matter what (-8 with multiple feats).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hand Double Crossbow (200 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/we/20060420a&quot;&gt;RoTD Web Enhancement&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;These probably lend themselves best to the machine gun-idea presented above. Wielding one of these in one hand only costs you -2 to hit and having free reload from Quick Loading or whatever would mean that you would get to take the extra attack with each plus full iteratives, along with Rapid Shots and what have you at reasonable penalties. This seems like a solid plan with Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77] to maximize the damage output.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Icechucker&lt;/span&gt; (150 gp) [Frost Pg. 77]&lt;br /&gt;This is really on the edge of not counting as a Crossbow. Anyways, it throws large shards of Ice as the name suggests, or alternatively Javelins when Ice isn't available. Unfortunately, bigger isn't always better it seems and the damage doesn't really increase at all and the range is poor. This is only good in very specific circumstances where Bolts are unavailable. Other than that, it's far worse than Great Crossbow and a total waste of Exotic Weapon Proficiency. I'm just mentioning it for completeness's sake.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Magic Weapons&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Armbow, Warforged (20000 gp) [ECS Pg. 268]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Warforged component and thus not available to anyone else. Anyways, we're talking about a +2 Repeating Light Crossbow here. However, unlike standard Repeating Crossbows, this one automatically reloads itself. Now, it can only make 20 bolts a day by itself after which you need to make extras at the rate of 1 HP/Bolt, but few heal-effects allow you to ignore such nonsense. You can also create Aligned Bolts with 3 HP a piece, a bargain to ignore annoying Damage Reductions - just make sure you have the means to restore your HP. The important part is that since the reloading happens automatically, I'd wager you can do flurries at will with these, even Two-Handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn't spelled out in the book (in fact, the only thing it states about the weapon is that &quot;shooting and loading it is a standard action&quot;, but seeing that we're talking about a Repeating Light Crossbow, it would seem logical to assume it can be used to fire iteratives at will. Also, no penalty is listed for using it one-handed, so technically you should be able to get two of these and use them without penalties other than the normal TWF-penalties. The only turnoff here is the fact that you do need Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Repeating Crossbow for these, but since the Heavy version isn't so bad for the early levels, it may not be that bad. The worse part is that you're a Warforged and thus don't get the Human Bonus Feat level 1, so you'll be really featstarved as you need:&lt;br /&gt;-Archery feats&lt;br /&gt;-Crossbow feats&lt;br /&gt;-Two-Weapon Fighting feats&lt;br /&gt;-Exotic Weapon Proficiency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, pulling it off just may be worth it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Magic Weapon Special Abilities&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Quick Loading&lt;/span&gt; (+1 price) [MiC Pg. 41]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This ability is very worthy for crossbow archers of certain archetypes. It's by far the simpliest way of enabling iterative attacks when dual wielding Crossbows. 100 bolts should be enough even for the longest of encounters after which you can spend a minute or two refilling the magazines. Furthermore, the ability allows you to choose which Bolt is loaded each time so you actually get free golfbag effect so typical for straight bows with this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it's available, I'd grab a pair of Light Crossbows with this. Unfortunately, loading Heavy Crossbow even with Quick-Loading is still a Move Action thus not helping there. Potentially, Quick-Loading Heavy Crossbow with Ghostly Reload cast on it could be used 10 times like normal Light Crossbows with the spell. This isn't spelled out anywhere though and would be purely a houserule, but an extremely logical one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Mundane Weapon Improvements&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Crossbow Sight, Gnome&lt;/span&gt; (+150 gp) [AE Pg. 36]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is again a 3.0 ability, but unfortunately they simply haven't printed much of use for Crossbows in 3.5; it's a fair game to go 3.0 in search of goodies. Anyways, this is effectively a Sniper Scope. With this, you can truly act as a Crossbow Sniper. Basically, this allows you to ignore up to two range increment. Yes, that's right, with a Crossbow Sight, you can use a standard Heavy Crossbow at the range of 360' without any penalties whatsoever! And with Far Shot et al. this gets much better. Very handy, especially in wilderness and areas with long vision, it costs you practically nothing and gives you a huge, if situational benefit so come midlevels, I'd get one immediately (it also allows using Hand Crossbow on medium ranges without penalties).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mounted Archery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rWT7gW9WI4w/Wl16Mt1q0aI/AAAAAAAABKY/9AeQFsTYUZUjPsxYSip7GAS602a3xOxxgCLcBGAs/s1600/Mongol%2Barcher.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;800&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1324&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rWT7gW9WI4w/Wl16Mt1q0aI/AAAAAAAABKY/9AeQFsTYUZUjPsxYSip7GAS602a3xOxxgCLcBGAs/s640/Mongol%2Barcher.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not even a mighty warrior can break a frail arrow when it is multiplied and supported by its fellows.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Genghis Khan &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Mounted combat isn't really the most common topic in D&amp;amp;D forums, but the game does support the combat style quite well. In fact, mounted combatants are at an immense advantage compared to normal characters since you get double moves and full-round actions at the same time. Historically, Mounted Archery was the advantage that allowed Genghis Khan to conquer the known world so there has to be something to this combat style in the game too, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mounted Archers are really efficient in the open simply due to the fact that they can keep firing while their Mount keeps them out of combat, and even more so with the more exotic mount options available, such as flying and teleporting monsters, and monsters that are fearsome combatants on their own rights all the way up to the almighty Dragons. The important part is getting a mount that isn't going to die midfight, and preferably one that can contribute itself. Early on, you can just shop for a mount, but later on you'll probably want a Mount as a class feature lest it gets toasted in the first AoE attack you face. Also, a Mounted Archer really wants to be small to be able to fit into most dungeons with the Mount; it sucks to have to give up the advantages a Mount offers just because you're in for a dungeon crawl. Even though mobility is limited in a dungeon, a Riding Dog moving each down with you shooting goes a long way to keeping you out of trouble. Just keep as much space available as possible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why choose mounted archery?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;What does fighting mounted actually do for an archer compared to his normal capabilities?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mobility (the most important reason to pick a mount by far - you can full attack while moving)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extra offense (the mount is often an able combatant on its own right)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extra protection (Ride-checks can be used to dodge attacks)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support character (some mounts, such as Unicorns, have very useful boost skills that can be used for you)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extra actions (mount can generally take actions separately of you on your initiative, effectively giving you extra actions)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use for class features such as Animal Companion and Familiar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Longbow cannot be used while mounted (curiously enough, Composite Longbows, on the other hand, can)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ties a skill and a half (Ride and potentially Handle Animal)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ties some more feats, making the otherwise more Mount-friendly Crossbow archery more difficult to pull off effectively (Mounted Combat and Mounted Archery are nearly musts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You need to acquire a Mount somehow, be it purchasing a Heavy Warhorse (400 gp) or having Mount- or Animal Companion-class features&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Mounts&lt;/h3&gt;Mounted combat is all fine and good, but you kind of need to get the Mount-part right first. There are various means to acquire a mount in D&amp;amp;D, but it mostly comes down to five options:-Buy one, possibly already trained-Tame/grow one yourself, by buying/finding eggs or simply using Handle Animal/Wild Empathy to get one to come along-Use classes with class features that can be used for Mounts (mostly Animal Companion and Mount)-Get the Leadership-feat and acquire a cohort that works as a Mount-Ride an ally such as party's wildshaped Druid.Feats and cohorts I'll cover later and riding an ally doesn't need to be covered, so this section will be about purchasable and tamable mounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riding Dog (150 gp) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#mountsAndRelatedGear&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good mount for small characters.

The mighty pegasus allows Good aligned riders access to flight (with a speed of 120 feet at average maneuverability) and can reliably detect good and evil, which can be handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's odd that the Monster Manual lists them as having eggs, though, as they are mammals who would logically give live birth. At least that's what My Little Pony taught me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hippogriff  (2000 gp for egg, 3000 gp for foal, 1000 gp to train) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/hippogriff.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can't have a pegasus, you can use the slightly slower Hippogriff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Griffon (3500 gp for egg, 7000 gp for young, 1500 gp to train) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/griffon.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The griffon has more HP than the pegasus, but has a fly speed of 80 feet. It has significantly improved combat abilities, but you hopefully won't need them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Spider Eater&lt;/span&gt; (2000 gp for egg, 3000 gp for young, 3000 gp to train) [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/spiderEater.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The Spider Eater costs quite a lot to train. In return, you get a mount with a 60 ft fly speed at good manevuerability, and a constant Freedom of Movement effect on itself, which is pretty handy to have. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Mounted Combat Feats&lt;/h4&gt;Mounted Combat [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#mountedCombat&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] - Requires Ride: 1 rank&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the core feat for Mounted Combat. Not only do many classes specializing in Mounted Combat require this, but this also allows you to keep your Mount quite safe; you can use your Ride-check instead of the Mount's AC once per round and pimping out checks is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mounted Archery [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#mountedArchery&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] - Requires Mounted Combat, Ride: 1 rank&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halves the penalties for firing atop a moving mount. Since being able to move while shooting is the only real reason for Mounted Archery in the first place, this feat is very much worth your trouble. Makes penalties 2 points lower when the mount is double moving and 4 points lower when the mount is running. Really handy overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Improved Mounted Archery&lt;/span&gt; [CW Pg. 101] - Requires Mounted Combat, Mounted Archery, Ride: 1 rank&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removes penalties for shooting atop a moving mount, reduces the penalties for shooting atop a running mount to -2, allows you to shoot at any point during the mount's movement (normally you must take the shots halfway through). If you've come this far, you may as well take this; being able to shoot at whatever point in the movement really makes a difference in restricted terrains such as dungeons and the lack of penalties is very much worth it if you already took Mounted Archery; may as well remove the penalties entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mounted Fighting [DR346 Pg. 86] - Requires Mounted Combat, BAB +8, Ride: 11 ranks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feat gives you +1 to hit and to damage on attacks made atop of a mount. A decent option if you've got feats to spare (seems highly unlikely though), but the bonuses are quite minor so it's not a high priority feat. Luckily it has effectively no prerequisites to speak of so you're fine in that regard; this feat wouldn't be worth going through loops for, but as it stands, I could see some builds picking it up eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tunnel Riding [RoS Pg. 145] - Requires Mounted Combat, Tunnel Fighting [RoS Pg. 145]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tunnel Fighting requires +1 BAB, so effectively you can't gain this before that either. Anyways, this feat can be very useful if you expect Dungeons and still want to use a Mount; with this and Tunnel Fighting, you and your mount can fight with no penalties when squeezing through narrow spaces. Normally you take -4 to attacks and AC, but with this you and your Large mount have no problems travelling corridors planned for Medium creatures. In the same vein, the Halfling and his mount have no trouble riding in corridors built for Small creatures. Yes, squeezing still costs 2 squares of movement, but your Mount has movement to spare and since you can fight without trouble when squeezing, feel free to bide your time. The only problem with this feat is the prerequisite; finding two spare feats for a Mounted Archer is a challenge of epic proportions. Otherwise this would be in blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trample [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#trample&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] - Requires Mounted Combat, Ride: 1 rank&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the wording on Overrun is a bit unclear, but it seems like your Mount can charge without you spending actions on it allowing you to keep shooting (it would probably count as running though), and that would allow your mount to make Overruns on the opponents. In that case, Trample can very much be worth it for hooving the Overran opponents in the face. It helps that your Mount tends to be strong and large.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;h4 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Mount Feats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Leadership &lt;/span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#leadership&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] - Requires Character Level 6th&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll get it out of the way - this is the most powerful feat in D&amp;amp;D. In fact, it's so powerful that when allowed in its full extent, Charisma suddenly becomes a pivotal stat for every class. However, the use suggested here isn't anything broken; I actually suggest you ask if you can skip the follower nonsense entirely when using it to acquire a Mount (that way the feat will be a bit more fair and you don't have a bunch of rabble getting in your way), possibly renaming it to &quot;Acquire Mount&quot; or something to that effect. Followers are generally used for Circle Magic, Aid Another and similar effects that get broken real fast when any sorts of numbers are present. If you can't get rid of them, have them build a castle or something. You've only got interest in the Cohort (although the highest level followers can be useful enough to keep along, especially if you're playing a Charisma-focused character). You can have your Cohort be either a Druid or some kind of an intelligent ridable creature, such as a Dragon, a Centaur, a Pegasus or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that Leadership is derived off your Charisma-score, so if using this to acquire a mount, make sure you've got high enough Charisma to acquire a strong one.This along with Wild Cohort is the only way to get a mount growing in power without devoting most of your class levels towards the goal. As such, if you're an aspiring Mounted Archer of a class that does not have a natural Animal Companion/Mount progression, this is probably the best route to take provided that you can spare the Charisma (16 Cha will get you max. level Cohort up to level 14; after that you need either other factors or items to improve Cha to keep it maxed; on level 19 you need Cha 20 for maxed Cohort, so if your core Cha is 14, you'll be able to max it out without depending on Reputation or needing to read Books). This is also the only Core-only feat for Mount acquisition.As a bonus, Leadership also qualifies you to a whole direction of character construction and a ton of other feats (among others, Improved Cohort [HoB Pg. 98], which allows you to cap your Cohort one level below you as opposed to two levels). Heroes of Battle is a good source for Leadership-based abilities, but it's all beyond the scope of this Handbook. Also note that when going to Epic, Epic Leadership [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/feats.htm#epicLeadership&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] allows you to continue Cohort-progression beyond level 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Wild Cohort&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/re/20031118a&quot;&gt;WoTC Site&lt;/a&gt;] - No prerequisites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're playing a character that doesn't naturally get an animal companion, this gets you one. On early levels, it's a perfectly able combatant and as it does advance decently by levels, it'll remain useful at least as a mount throughout your career. This also just so happens to kick Ranger's animal companions ass - just an additional reason to trade it away. So yes, right here you've got a feat that allows you to acquire a perfectly usable Mount as any class.This is cleaner than Leadership, less broken, and doesn't require any Charisma out of you so much of the time picking Wild Cohort will be less hassle. You might want to pick Natural Bond later to improve your companion a bit though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Devoted Tracker&lt;/span&gt; [CAdv Pg. 108] - Requires Track, smite evil, wild empathy&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feat combines Ranger and Paladin-progressions, and allows you to designate your Special Mount as your Animal Companion, stacking the benefits. Thanks to the fact that Ranger isn't the only class with Animal Companion, it does much more than just stacks Ranger and Paladin. This feat allows you to take levels in Halfling Outrider PrC [CW Pg. 38] to effectively get two levels of advancement for your Mount per one level of Halfling Outrider!This is what the so-called &quot;Supermount&quot;-builds are based on and is the source of tremendously powerful Mounts, ones that can put the rider to shame, especially combined with other feats in this chapter. When going for a strong Mount, this is the first thing to go for. Remember that it ties a lot of class levels to truly work out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celestial Mount [BoED Pg. 42] - Requires Paladin Level 4th, Exalted&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives your Mount the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/celestialCreature.htm&quot;&gt;Celestial&lt;/a&gt;-template. This includes minor Spell Resistance (5+HD; Devoted Tracker means he'll have lots of HD though so it'll be fine until it caps at 25), minor Damage Reduction (X/Magic, rather trivial, but gives the Mount's natural weapons the ability to bypass DR/Magic too), 60' Darkvision and some Energy Resistances. It isn't an incredible template by any stretch of imagination, but it allows you to make unintelligent companions intelligent (raises Int to 3 if it's lower than that) and if you have feats to spare, might as well. It isn't horrible. It's Exalted though so beware if you aren't Very Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Holy Mount &lt;/span&gt;[DR325 Pg. 62] - Requires Special Mount class feature, any other Divine caster class&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to stack your Paladin-levels with the Divine casting class in question to determine the abilities of your Mount. Great for attaining a strong mount without taking excess levels in a rather weak class such as Paladin; goes even better with Prestige Paladin [SRD], of which you only need to take two levels to qualify for the Mount, and which advances the spellcasting of any Divine caster class you take. After that you can go straight Cleric or similar. In Supermount-builds, this is usually used to stack e.g. Ranger-levels with Paladin-levels to get two levels worth of Mount every time you get one level in Outrider. This is solid even when not going for those 50HD Mounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Theurgic Mount&lt;/span&gt; [DR325 Pg. 62] - Requires Special Mount class feature, any Arcane caster class&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows you to stack your Paladin-levels with the Arcane casting class in question to determine the abilities of your Mount. This is usually used to stack Paladin with Fey Bard to take levels in Animal Companion and Mount at the same time. With this, you basically turn Halfling Outrider into: Every level, your Mount advances 3 levels and your Animal Companion two - you just need a level in Druidish class (Beastmaster [CAdv Pg. 26]), Rangerish class (Prestige Ranger [SRD]), Paladinish class (Prestige Paladin [SRD]) and you may as well top it off with another Druidish class (Fey Bard [SRD]) that stacks with Beastmaster and thus stacks with Paladin for Mount through Halfling Outrider thanks to Theurgic Mount. Note that not all DMs are going to allow them to stack as written, limiting it by your HD. Even then this feat allows you to have a fully powered up Mount off a class that normally has no Mount advancement; well worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Dragon Cohort &lt;/span&gt;[Drac Pg. 104] - Requires Character Level 9th, Speak Language: Draconic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an alternative to Leadership for those who wish to become dragonriders! Dragon Cohort has none of the associated Followers-nonsense that comes with Leadership and the list of Cohorts is limited, as the name suggests, to Dragons only. Basically, this feat allows you to cut 3 levels of adjustment away from the effective Cohort-level of the Dragon Ally you want; this allows you to have a Cohort of adjusted level up to 20 (for example, Young Gold Dragon) by the end of the progression. Otherwise it's identical to Leadership in that you again need some Charisma to attract a Cohort of certain level, and that the Cohort doesn't take a part of your Experience, etc. This is very good, easily the best lone investment for attaining a Mount of sufficient power level (although Leadership is of course the more powerful feat; that's another reason this is better, this is actually likely to be allowed). Note that Dragons have the Alternate Form-ability, which allows them to assume a medium Human or Animal-form to accompany you to places where they normally wouldn't fit. You can have them take a Medium Animal-form to ride in a dungeon, for example (you can also get Shrink Person on you if need be).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Dragon Steed &lt;/span&gt;[Drac Pg. 105] - Requires Cha 13, Ride: 8 ranks, Speak Language: Draconic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feat allows you to get a loyal Dragonnel [Drac Pg. 151] mount, much like you'd get a Cohort. This isn't very impressive; Dragonnels aren't earthshattering to any degree. However, the true use of this feat is that a Paladin picking this feat can trade his Special Mount for a Draconic Mount! Initially it's just Dragonnel, but with a couple of levels (level 12th gets you a Wyrmling Gold, although if you're Medium you'll need to wait until effective level 16 to get Very Young Gold) under your belt, you can get a True Dragon as your Mount! Now, this requires you to enable it to build a lair and to give it 1000gp per HD worth of treasure, but who cares! You're riding a Dragon! Also, you can make your Cohort your Mount to stack stuff. Stacking stuff tends to lead to very powerful builds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Natural Bond &lt;/span&gt;[CAdv Pg. 111] - Requires Animal companion&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archers multiclass a lot. Builds that fool around pimping out their Mount tend to multiclass even more. This here feat allows you to make up for the multiclassing and pick up extra effective level to pump up your companion with. Thanks to Devoted Tracker, you can make your companion your Mount and thus pretty much directly apply the +3 adjustment to your Mount/Companion, since the levels you used to gain the Mount are probably levels that did not advance your Companion, thus giving you the HD to apply Natural Bond-adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Theurgic Bond [DR325 Pg. 62] - Requires Ability to gain an animal companion, Ability to gain a familiar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feat allows you to either add your Familiar-levels to advancing your Animal Companion or your Animal Companion-levels to advancing your Familiar. Can be handy if you have Arcane casting levels, but due to the fact that there are precious few dual advancement classes for Familiar and Animal companion, not quite as potent as the other combination feats available. Still, it's very handy for multiclassing into Arcane classes while maintaining your Animal companion's potency. Mounted combatants will probably not be applying this to their Familiars though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Martial Archers &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y7BXPX55I1k/WlqpnktKWNI/AAAAAAAABGI/yFc6pt-jHN8lFmr0JZqFxP_Qcj_QryvsQCLcBGAs/s1600/Martial%2BArcher.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;291&quot; data-original-width=&quot;480&quot; height=&quot;387&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Y7BXPX55I1k/WlqpnktKWNI/AAAAAAAABGI/yFc6pt-jHN8lFmr0JZqFxP_Qcj_QryvsQCLcBGAs/s640/Martial%2BArcher.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;With Bow let us win cattle, with Bow the battle, with Bow be victors in our hot encounters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman: armed with the Bow may we subdue all regions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;-The Rig-Veda, Mandala 6, Hymn 75&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Rangers and Fighters are the most obvious Archer-classes in the Player's Handbook. As such, it's really annoying that both, Fighter 20 and Ranger 20 make for rather poor archers in the long run. A straight Fighter has somewhat better overall damage, while a Ranger has the necessary skills down and performs quite well against their Favored Enemies, but they're overall quite poor archers right out of the box. Make no mistake, a martial Archer is going to want to multiclass. Otherwise it's just nowhere near the potency of magically enhanced archers or martial melee. This is further compounded by the fact that 3.5 doesn't really have that much in terms of good Archer Prestige Classes so that's not a doable escape either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, this section is not going to go into great deal of depth as to how to build an effective straight-classed Fighter or Ranger Archers simply because that's not going to happen. I'll spare a few words for the awesome Targetteer Fighter, but even then, you're better off multiclassing, and I'm going to refer to 3.0 Prestige Classes practically constantly. Basically, Weapon Supremacy just isn't all that good for archers (as archery in D&amp;amp;D relies on volleys for damage on higher levels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, when it comes to Barbarians, things get interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The default Barbarian isn't suited for archery, but he does have access to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/classFeatureVariants.htm#rageVariantWhirlingFrenzy&quot;&gt;Whirling Frenzy&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A barbarian with this variant form of rage doesn't gain the normal  bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, when a barbarian with whirling  frenzy enters a rage, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a  +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling  frenzy, the barbarian may make one extra attack in a round at his  highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does  each other attack made that round. This penalty applies for 1 round, so  it also affects attacks of opportunity the barbarian might make before  his next action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whirling Frenzy is otherwise identical to the  standard barbarian rage in all other ways. At 11th level (when a  standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Strength bonus increases to  +6, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to  +3. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the  Strength bonus increases to +8, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and  on Reflex saves increases to +4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A barbarian using this variant  doesn't gain indomitable will at 14th level. Instead, he gains evasion,  but only while in a whirling frenzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A character can't use whirling frenzy at the same time that he uses any other form of rage (or similar ability).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Screw you, Rapid Shot! Whirling Frenzy is where it's at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main downsides are the limited number of times you can rage and the duration of the rage, but that can be easily addressed with the proper race selection, ability score allocation, feat choices, and multiclassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus to Strength is also handy, and helps alleviate some of the MAD faced by archers. You'll want one of the bows that automatically adjusts to your Strength modifier to make the best use of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a Martial Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of us just want to play a guy who's really good with a bow. He wins because he's just better with the weapon than anyone else on any plane of existence. This section examines just how you should go about creating an efficient martial archer. First, remember that the primary issue when building any archer is dealing decent damage on higher levels. When opponents only have 4 HP a piece, dealing an average of 4.5 damage per hit is just fine, but unlike in melee, a ranged character does not have Power Attack to pump their damage output later on and when dealing with opponents having 200+ HP, dealing 15 damage per hit with 5 shots per turn is going to take long while to kill anything, especially if they have DR. Further, they either need a different stat for damage and to hit (straight bows), or can only add half their to hit-stat to damage (crossbows), which causes even more issues as far as raising the damage goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, let's get down to business:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Martial Archers want some means to gain Weapon Specialization to qualify for Ranged Weapon Mastery. The two feats give you a very real damage increase, and really improve your overall performance as an archer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generally, you'll want to at least dip a class that gains Spot as a class skill (Ranger is great), since a straight Martial Archer has no range-related bonuses beyond Point Blank Shot and therefore, you want to be able to engage the opponent from as far away as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try to find some means to gain the ability to make Power Shots (to use Power Attack with a ranged weapon). The easiest means to gain it is to buy an Energy Bow (covered in Traditional Archery -&amp;gt; Equipment), but you could also ask if the Peerless Archer Prestige Class is available, or if you could homebrew the feat (since that'd be quite logical).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do try to maximize the enhancements of your bow. Having a +1 bow with +9 worth of special abilities with Greater Magic Weapon cast on it, a weapon crystal and using enhanced arrows is going to go a long way towards dealing the damage on higher levels. Feats (covered in Archery General) are generally the most efficient means to do this, although Kensai-levels can accomplish this as well. Of course, you'll wish to have a party crafter around if possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martial Archers are feat starved. And martial classes are often not great in terms of long term feat rewards. Try to get as many bonus feats as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prestige classes to aim for are Deepwood Sniper, Peerless Archer, or the Sword and Fist version of Order of the Bow Initiate. Perhaps Exotic Weapon Master if you've picked up an exotic bow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;You can maximize the number of useful feats and skill points with martial classes is to take 2 levels of Ranger for Combat Style: Rapid Shot and a generous amount of skill points, then dip two levels of fighter for bonus feats. This allows you to maximize the number of attacks you can make in a round.&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure your GM doesn't enforce multiclassing penalties if you want to dip Barbarian. If he does, you'll need to take extra Barbarian levels. Barbarian 2 isn't too bad, since you get Uncanny Dodge. Barbarian 3 grants Trapsense +1, which can thankfully be traded out for the Spell Sense ACF [CM Pg. 35], which grants your Trapsense bonus to your AC as a dodge bonus against spells and SLAs. It's not huge, but it's better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ranger can be useful for up to two more levels. Another level of Ranger gets you a good number of skill points and Endurance, which qualifies you for Horizon Walker. Immunity to Fatigue from Whirling Frenzy's not a bad, Darkvision helps, and Dimension Door is very useful. 6 levels of Horizon Walker is not a bad diversion while you work on qualifying for archery prestige classes. (&quot;I will teleport around shooting you in the face in the dark without ever feeling tired &quot; worked pretty well in Diablo 2) It's certainly better than some archery prestige classes that could be named.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At level 4, Ranger enables you to swap out your animal companion for the Distracting Attack ACF [PHBII Pg. 55], which allows you and your allies to treat whenever you hit an enemy with a weapon attack (whether melee or ranged), as flanked on the next attack he is subjected to. It's not the most powerful ability, but it could be handy in the right kind of party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great Ranger ACF to take is the Arcane Hunter ACF [CM Pg .32] for the Ranger. In exchange for one rank in Knowledge: Arcana, you get Favored Enemy: Arcanists. Anything that casts arcane spells or SLAs is now your prey. Pretty handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's nothing to be said for Fighter level 3 (it is dumb level, Thog not take), but Fighter 4 nets you another feat and qualifies you for Weapon Specialization, a prerequisite for Ranged Weapon Mastery. Ranged Weapon Mastery is not the most amazing feat, but it's quite a nice option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a Fighter ACF that works great for archers, the Hit-and-Run Drow Fighter ACF [DotU Pg. 58] grants a +2 untyped initiative bonus and Dex to damage against flat-footed enemies within 30 feet in exchange for heavy armor and tower shield proficiency. Sounds like a win-win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Martial Rogue and Cloistered Cleric from Unearthed Arcana are good options for extra feats, although neither are, strictly speaking, martial classes.There is a mini-guide to selecting Cloistered Cleric domains for fun and profit in the Divine section of the guide if this interests you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;I must admit, I am partial to an Arcane Hunter Ranger 2/Hit-and-Run Fighter 4 with the feats Education (1), Knowledge Devotion (3), Weapon Focus (6), Rapid Shot (Ranger 2), Point Blank Shot (Fighter 1), Precise Shot (Fighter 2), Weapon Specialization (Fighter 4). Next comes 2 levels of Barbarian for Whirling Frenzy and Uncanny Dodge. Grab an extra level Ranger and use the Endurance to qualify for Horizon Walker. Take Ranged Weapon Mastery. Throw Quicken SLA on Dimension Door. Have fun. &quot;I will teleport around shooting you with arrows in the face and never getting tired of it&quot; worked in Diablo 2 and it will work here!&lt;br /&gt;-Solo&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem odd that I don't really recommend an archery prestige class for an archer, but most of the options aren't worthwhile. Let's take a look.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Deepwood Sniper [MotW]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements&lt;br /&gt;Base Attack Bonus: +5&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Hide 4 ranks, Move Silently 4 ranks, Spot 4 ranks.&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus (any bow or crossbow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first level, the critical threat range of arrows increases by 1, and the range increment of a bow or crossbow increases by 10ft/level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At second level, you reduce your miss chance against an opponent by 10% (and by an additional 10% per four Deepwood Sniper levels). Once per day, the Deepwood Sniper's bow can be affected as if by a Magic Weapon spell. The Damage critical multiplier of arrows or bolts fired increases by 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At third level, you get safe poison use. LAME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fourth level, you get a small bonus to attack as long as you spend a full round aiming, and the victim stands still. Any ability that can be foiled by the enemy walking at a brisk pace is LOW ENERGY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fifth level, you get the ability to reroll an attack roll once per day. SAD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No new abilities until 10th level, where you get to produce a True Strike effect once per day. DISAPPOINTING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judgement: This prestige class runs out of steam after two levels. It offers a few useful minor benefits in exchange for a mediocre feat. It's not a bad investment for two levels, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peerless Archer [SM]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;Base Attack Bonus: +7&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Craft (bowmaking) 10 ranks&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Point Blank Shot, Far Shot, Precise Shot, Quick Draw&lt;br /&gt;Proficiency: Longbow, shortbow, composite longbow, or composite shortbow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first level, you gain what is essentially Skill Focus: Craft Bow. You also gain +1d6 ranged sneak attack, which is probably the more useful ability. The sneak attack increases by +1d6 every 3 levels hereafter, to a maximum of +4d6 at level 10. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At second level, you reduce the level of concealment enemies have by one step, and can craft magic arrows as if you had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat. You start off making +1 arrows, which increases by +1 every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 10th level. You don't get the ability to add weapon enchantments (eg Splitting, Force), so this isn't that useful, especially if you have a someone in the party willing to cast Greater Magic Weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At third level, you gain the Power Shot ability. Finally, ranged Power Attack! This is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No new abilities until 8th level, where you get the Threaten ability which allows you to treat your bow as if it were a 10ft reach weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judgement: Just take Deadly Aim and wield a bowstaff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order of the Bow Initiate [S&amp;amp;F]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements&lt;br /&gt;Base Attack Bonus: +5&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Knowledge (religion) 2 ranks&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow or shortbow), Weapon Specialization (longbow or shortbow)&lt;br /&gt;Proficiency: Longbow or shortbow or composite longbow or composite shortbow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;At first level, you get +1d6 range sneak attack, which increases as you take more levels. Why do all these ranged prestige classes give you an ability that only works at close range? It's not bad, it's just not that useful given the limitations. You want to shoot people in the face from far away, not within charging distance &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At second level, your attacks with a ranged weapon in a threatened area and not provoke an attack of opportunity. This is pretty awesome, although it'd be best if you weren't in melee to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;At level four, you get Superior Weapon Focus: an additional +1 to attack rolls with a bow, This one must have taken a lot of creativity and effort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At level six, you get a free attack at any enemy who is subject to an AoO from an ally, and the Zen Archery feat. It's a bit late to get Zen Archery as a bonus feat, as anyone who needs it would have taken it by now, but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that anyone who did take it now benefits from adding his Dexterity modifier and his Wisdom modifier for ranged attacks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At seventh level, you gain Superior Weapon Specialization, an additional +2 to damage rolls with a bow. Truly one of the most attractive features of this class!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At ninth level, you gain the Banked Shot ability. This allows you to fire an arrow at a target within 20 feet of a wall (but not adjacent to the wall) and treat the target as if flat-footed for purposes of AC and damage inflicted as a full-round action. This is both practically and impractically useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Judgement: Either leave at level 2 or level 6, It's fortunate that the prerequisites are likely things you'll have taken anyways, so it's easy to get into when you have nothing better to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order of the Bow Initiate [CW]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements&lt;br /&gt;Base Attack Bonus: +5&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Craft (bowmaking) 5 ranks , Knowledge (religion) 2 ranks&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Point Blank Shot , Precise Shot , Rapid Shot , Weapon Focus (longbow, shortbow, or composite version of either)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;At first level, you get Ranged Precision. This is much like the 3.0 ability Ranged Sneak Attack, except that you must use a standard action to deliver a single attack to an enemy within 30 feet that deals +1d8 precision damage, which increases by +1d8 every 2 levels to a maximum of +5d8 at 9th level. At least the target does not need to be denied its Dexterity bonus or be flat-footed in order to take this damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At second level, you gain Close Combat Shot. This is much the same as the 3.0 version, so not much needs to be said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At fourth level, you gain Greater Weapon Focus. A rose by any other name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At level 6, you gain the Sharp Shooting feat. It's bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 10th level, you double the distance at which you can use Ranged Precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Judgement: This version is only good for two levels, and only if you really want to shoot people up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exotic Weapon Master&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements&lt;br /&gt;Base Attack Bonus: +6&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Craft (Weaponsmithing) 3 ranks&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (any exotic weapon) , Weapon Focus (any exotic weapon)&lt;br /&gt;Special: Races that have familiarity with an exotic weapon (such as the dwarf's familiarity with the dwarven waraxe and the dwarven urgrosh) are considered to have the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat for the purpose of meeting the requirements for this class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each of the three levels of Exotic Weapon Master allows you to choose a stunt. The most useful ones are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close-Quarters Ranged Combat – You don't provoke an attack of opportunity when using an exotic ranged weapon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ranged Disarm – You can make a disarm attempt on a ranged attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twin Exotic Weapon Fighting: lessens TWF penalties when using exotic weapons, such as hand crossbows. (But good luck getting the feats to pull off crossbows.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Judgement: Short, easy to qualify for, and grants a Close Combat Shot.equivalent faster than OotBI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Ranged Weapon Mastery&lt;/span&gt; [PHBII Pg. 82] - Requires Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, BAB +8&lt;br /&gt;A feat that makes Weapon Focus-tree almost worth taking. +2 to hit AND damage (with one damage type) is very good for just one feat and you get a range increase on top of that! It also requires Weapon Specialization, but not any actual Fighter-levels, so if you can get Weapon Specialization through means other than Fighter-levels (for example Pious Templar [CD Pg. 50] gets it as a bonus feat), you also qualify for Ranged Weapon Mastery. A very handy damage, range, and To Hit increase.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Skirmish Archers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-crFb5KDayb4/WlqsBx8LO-I/AAAAAAAABGU/93TH75L2qiMRdpvIHSnr-rI9nPmgeswhQCLcBGAs/s1600/Skirmish%2Barcher.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;450&quot; data-original-width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-crFb5KDayb4/WlqsBx8LO-I/AAAAAAAABGU/93TH75L2qiMRdpvIHSnr-rI9nPmgeswhQCLcBGAs/s640/Skirmish%2Barcher.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Move as swiftly as the Wind, be as supple as the Forest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Attack as fiercely as Fire, be as firm as the Mountain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Be as mysterious as a Shadow, strike as fast as Lightning.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Sun Tzu, The Art of War &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Skirmishing was always a tactic in Dungeons and Dragons, but the Complete Adventurer's Scout class was the first to be built around the concept. Its skirmish ability adds bonus damage dice to attacks made after moving. However, there were few ways to gain iterative attacks after moving, and Skirmish explicitly does not work with mounted archery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that changed in 2007, with the release of two books. But more on those later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a Skirmish Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;There are a few things to keep in mind when building a skirmisher.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are no longer Strength dependent to deal damage. Unfortunately, this also means that you must now contend with creatures who are immune to precision damage – and unlike the Rogue, you do not have any means of overcoming this on your own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a good amount of skills, which means that maneuvering and spotting enemies will be easy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generating multiple attacks is key to a high damage output. You want Rapid Shot. You want Manyshot. You want Splitting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must be able to move around and take full attacks. Ideally, you will have multiple ways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This is pointed out in the Precision Archer section later, but don't forget the Hunter's Eye spell from the Player's Handbook II! It is a swift action 2nd level Ranger spell which grants +1d6 Sneak Attack for ever 3 caster levels. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Swift Hunter&lt;/span&gt; [CS,&amp;nbsp; Pg. 81] – Requires Skirmish +1d6/+1 AC, Favored Enemy&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This is the most important feat to take when building a Skirmisher.

In addition, this type of archery works well within the dungeon, where mobility may be hindered, and hiding spaces plentiful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Building a Precision Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Classes that grant Precision damage are often sneaky, so catching an enemy flat-footed is not the issue.Reliably denying them their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class afterward is. In addition, archers must find a way around enemies immune to precision damage. Once these are dealt with, the Sneak Attack archer  becomes a potent damage dealer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A few major points, then. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;You must emphasize stealth so that you can maximize your chances of sneak attacking enemies. Strongly consider the Darkstalker feat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A high Initiative score is vital for going first after a surprise attack, since the enemy is flat-footed until their turn starts. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0018.html&quot;&gt;Relevant OoTS&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wands are your friend.

Or it might cause them to fall prone,  which is also good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Hit-and-Run Fighter ACF [DotU, Pg. 58] replaces the Fighter's 1st level proficiency with heavy armor and shields (even affecting those gained by previous classes) for a +2 bonus to initiative and the ability to add the Fighter's Dexterity modifier as a competence bonus to damage rolls on enemies within 30 feet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Craven &lt;/span&gt;[CoR Pg. 17] – Cannot be immune to fear, must have Sneak Attack&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are cowardly enough to warrant a -2 penalty on saves against fear, but you are also willing to fight dirty and deal an extra point of sneak attack damage for each character level you have.

You also grant yourself and nearby allies a competence bonus to initiative equal to your class level and reduce penalties for sneaking around and sneaking in armor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it requires two feats that you may not have room for. The Mobility armor property can help with one of those, but you're out of luck for the other.

It also advances sneak attack, grants various immunities, constant Protection from Evil, and allows you to overcome the Damage Reduction of undead, as well as attack incoporeal undead. It's probably not worth going for all those abilities, though; 3-4 levels should get you all that you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Unseen Seer&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; [CM, Pg. 81]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Requirements:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Search 8 ranks, Sense Motive 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, Spot 8 ranks&lt;br /&gt;Spellcasting: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells, including at least two divination spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;This class has 3/4th BAB, 10/10 spellcasting progression, advances damage for Sneak Attack, Sudden Strike, or Skirmish, grants additional Divination spells known (including ones from Divine spell lists, like Hunter's Eye), increases the caster level of Divination spells, grants the Silent Spell feat, and continual nondetection.

You can use him to block enemies set off traps, and make tea, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flame's Blessing (1st level Stance) – Fire resistance isn't bad, but isn't that useful either.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Wind Stride&lt;/span&gt; (1st level Boost) – A bonus to movement speed could be handy depending on your playstyle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fan the Flames (3rd level Strike) – You launch a Hadoken at an enemy within 30 feet, dealing 6d6 fire damage with a ranged touch attack. It can be used for Sneak Attacks, but isn't that great overall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Holocaust Cloak&lt;/span&gt; (3rd level Stance) – The stance might be worth considering for emergencies if it did more damage to your attackers or wasn't negated by a reach weapon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zephyr Dance (3rd level Counter) – A +4 Dodge bonus to AC against a single attack as an immediate action isn't too bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firesnake (4th level Strike) – It can certainly make it harder for enemies to get close to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Leaping Flame &lt;/span&gt;(5th level Counter) – You probably don't want to teleport next to an enemy as an archer. You can teleport next to an ally if they attack you, but that's too convoluted for my taste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Rising Phoenix&lt;/span&gt; (8th level Stance) – You get to hover a bit. Not impressive in the late game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Devoted Spirit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aura of Perfect Order (6th level Stance)– It may be useful to treat a D20 as having rolled an 11, but I can't find two other Devoted Spirit maneuvers to take for the prerequisites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immortal Fortitude (8th level Stance) – Not dying from hitpoint damage is great, but there's so many other ways to die at this level. And there's no way to fill the prerequisites with anything useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Diamond Mind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Moment of Perfect Mind&lt;/span&gt; (1st level Counter) – This could be a lifesafer against illusions, blinding, mind control, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stance of Clarity (1st level Stance) – Situational. Only useful when you have more to worry from enemy archers than melee.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Action Before Thought (2nd level Counter) – You should have high Dexterity, but you can take this if you're still worried about Reflex saves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Mind Over Body&lt;/span&gt; (3rd level Counter) – It be used to shore up a Fortitude save, if you skimped out on Constitution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pearl of Black Doubt (3rd level Stance) – You really shouldn't be in a situation where this applies, but it would be nice to have if you were.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Hearing the Air&lt;/span&gt; (5th level Stance) – Blindsense out to 30 feet and a +5 bonus to Listen checks can help detect ambushes and pinpoint invisible creatures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Moment of Alacrity&lt;/span&gt; (6th level Boost) – Moving up in the initiative order never hurt anyone!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Quicksilver Motion&lt;/span&gt; (7th level Boost) – Using a swift action to get a free move action is great for an archer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diamond Defense (8th level Counter) – The bonus to any save will be smaller than that of the lower level save boosting counters if you've leveled Concentration, but this could be taken as a backup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stance of Alacrity (8th level Stance) – It certainly helps your action economy with counters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Time Stands Still&lt;/span&gt; (9th level Strike) – Yes, two full round attacks in one round is golden! And maybe combine it with Moment of Alacrity if anyone is left alive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iron Heart&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wall of Blades (2nd level Counter) – This lets you make a melee attack roll to substitute for your AC against an enemy attack. It may look cool to bat an arrow out of the air with your gauntlet or block a sword with your elvencraft bow, but it's still not a great idea. That being said, it fulfills the prerequisites for other Iron Heart maneuvers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Iron Heart Surge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (3rd level Counter) – Alright, now we're talking! This maneuver grants a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls until the start of your next turns. It also ends many negative status as a byproduct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absolute Steel Stance (3rd level Stance) – This gives you a +2 Dodge  bonus to AC if you move 10 or more feet in a round. There may be some  synergy with skirmishing here. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iron Heart Focus (5th level Counter) – Worth taking if you don't have access to Diamond Mind, or are paranoid about saving throws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iron Heart Endurance (6th level Boost) – Self-healing can save your bacon in a pinch, but isn't a primary concern for an archer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Setting Sun&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counter Charge (1st level Counter) – I suppose you could use this if being charged by the enemy is a concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Mighty Throw (1st level Strike) – It can certainly be used to get an opponent off of you, but your team would have had to fail pretty badly for this to be an issue. This can go for all of the other throwing maneuvers. The higher you get, the less useful they are to an archer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Step of the Wind&lt;/span&gt; (1st level Stance) – Ignoring movement penalties can be handy. In addition, you get a +2 on attack rolls and a +4 bonus bull rush and trip attempts against enemies you attack who are standing on difficult terrain and suffer movement penalties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baffling Defense (2nd level Counter) – You can take this if you have a good Sense Motive check. Changes are you won't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghostly Defense (8th level Stance) – You can cause enemy friendly fire this way, but it'd be best not to be surrounded by enemies in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shadow Hand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Child of Shadow&lt;/span&gt; (1st level Stance) – Concealment if you move 10 feet? Sounds good to me!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Cloak of Deception&lt;/span&gt; (2nd level Boost) – Invisibility is also good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Shadow Jaunt&lt;/span&gt; (2nd level Maneuver) – Short ranged teleport is great for escaping dangerous situations or maneuvering into position for an ambush.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Assassin's Stance&lt;/span&gt; (3rd level Stance) – A stance that grants +2d6 Sneak Attack? This keeps getting better and better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Dance of the Spider&lt;/span&gt; (3rd level Stance) – Being able to walk on walls keeps you away from the enemy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shadow Garrote (3rd level Strike) – You can trigger Sneak Attack with this ranged touch attack, but it's not particularly useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Shadow Stride&lt;/span&gt; (5th level Maneuver) – Shadow Jaunt as a move action. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Step of the Dancing Moth &lt;/span&gt;(5th level Stance) – It allows you to hover and ignore difficult terrain and some traps, but more important is the ability to ignore the Hide and Move Silently penalties for moving quickly, which can help out with scouting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shadow Noose (6th level Strike) – Much like Shadow Garrote.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Shadow Blink&lt;/span&gt; (7th level Maneuver) – Teleportation as a swift action is a fantastic way to scoot and shoot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Balance on the Sky&lt;/span&gt; (8th level Stance) – You must have one hand free to use this Stance. Most archers need that hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One with Shadow (8th level Counter) – You gain the incoporeal subtype, which is both a defensive and mobility option. The template description states that objects which leave an incoporeal creature's possession become coporeal, so you can shoot arrows without issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stone Dragon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;This school offers nothing of value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Tiger Claw&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Blood in the Water&lt;/span&gt; (1st level Stance) – You likely won't be generating enough criticals to make use of this, but if you can somehow make it work, feel free to use this stance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hunter's Sense (1st level Stance) – Scent can be a useful ability for scouting and detecting invisible enemies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Sudden Leap&lt;/span&gt; (1st level Boost) – It's a mobility option and costs a swift action, which means that with a high enough Jump check,&amp;nbsp; you could move and still shoot. You'll still incur an Attack of Opportunity, though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Leaping Dragon Stance&lt;/span&gt; (3rd level Stance) – It grants a +10 enhancement bonus to jump checks, and lets you make standing jumps as if you had a 20ft running start. This will let you jump around shooting people when combined with Sudden Leap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Dancing Mongoose &lt;/span&gt;(Level 5 Boost) – While the language used in this maneuver clearly intends for it to be used in two weapon combat, nowhere does it specify it must be done with melee weapons. Thus, an archer can use it to gain an additional attack at his highest BAB for each weapon he wields against an enemy he made an attack roll against in the round he initiated the boost.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Raging Mongoose&lt;/span&gt; (8th level Boost) – This functions exactly like Dancing Mongoose, except it gives you two attacks for each weapon you are wielding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;White Raven&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bolstering Voice (1st level Stance) – A bonus to will saves may be useful on occasion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Leading the Charge&lt;/span&gt; (1st level Stance) – Definitely not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Lion's Roar&lt;/span&gt; (3rd level Boost) – Gain a +5 damage bonus for one round after reducing an enemy to 0 HP or fewer. Damage boosts are always good for archers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White Raven Tactics (3rd level Boost) – This is a great teamwork maneuver, but not for archery. Still, it could offer a tactical advantage in general.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Press the Advantage&lt;/span&gt; (5th level Stance) – Taking an extra 5ft step offers a decent amount of maneuverability. In fact, it's just enough to trigger Skirmish. You can also step out from behind cover, take a full attack, and step back behind cover.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Order Forged from Chaos (6th level Maneuver) – Not relevant to archery, but may offer tactical benefits such as forming defensive lines against enemy attackers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Overall Tome of Battle offers melee potent options in terms of maneuverability, defenses, and action economy. Some of this is useful to the archer, especially multiclassed archers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Shadow Trickster&lt;/span&gt; [ToB, Pg. 32] – Requires caster level 1, one Shadow Hand strike&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are in a Shadow Hand stance, this feat boosts your save DCs for illusions by +2 and grants a +2 bonus on the damage rolls for Sneak Attack and Sudden Strike. The only downside is that you have to take a level in a spellcasting class. I'm sorry, did I say downside?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Song of the White Raven&lt;/span&gt; [ToB, Pg. 32] – Requires Bardic Music (Inspire Courage, one White Raven maneuver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are in a White Raven stance, you may activate Inspire Courage as a swift action and stack Bard and Crusader and Warblade levels for determining the bonus granted by Inspire Courage. See the Inspiring Archer section for more information on Inspire Courage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Incarnum Archers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HpdKHWIQyHI/WlsW2oKoaHI/AAAAAAAABHg/ccZDoG9bbgsYOyZp75vhzJyRsZ42bqpZQCLcBGAs/s1600/Sailor%2BMars.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;386&quot; data-original-width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;616&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HpdKHWIQyHI/WlsW2oKoaHI/AAAAAAAABHg/ccZDoG9bbgsYOyZp75vhzJyRsZ42bqpZQCLcBGAs/s640/Sailor%2BMars.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;It is not the arrow that is the weapon, but the archer.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Incarnum is one of the underused subsystems that came out late in 3.5E's lifetime, which is a pity because it's rather fun. By allowing classes to essentially create their own magic items, it offered a variety of flexible and interesting options for non-spellcasters. And fortunately, some of those options apply to archery!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building an Incarnum Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;Your meldshapng defines your capabilities, so we must take a close look at the soulmelds. There are two paths to take: using soulmelds to support bow based archery, or using soulmelds that grant ranged attacks. This guide will focus on the former.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soulmelds for Archery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Bluesteel Bracers –&lt;/span&gt; These grant a +2 bonus to initiative. In addition, they grant +1 to damage on weapon rolls per essentia invested. If bound to the arms, the bonuses are shared with allies within 30 feet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky Dice – Swift action to use, requires a 2d6 dice roll to activate. If the roll totals 7, you gain&amp;nbsp; +1 to attack/damagerolls, saves, and ability/skill checks for 1 round, +1 round per essentia invested. Any other roll and you have to choose one of the three. If bound to your hands, you will share the bonuses with allies within 30 feet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Sighting Gloves&lt;/span&gt; – These grant a +1 insight bonus on ranged damage per  point of essentia invested. If bound to the hands, they grant the  benefits of the Precise Shot feat, though not the feat itself. If you  will be taking Precise Shot to qualify for feats, you might as well bind  the Lucky Dice to your hands.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Fellmist Robe&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; –&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Concealment vs ranged attacks 10% base, with an additional 5% per essentia invested. Binding it to the soul will apply the concealment to adjacent attackers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Bonus Essentia&lt;/span&gt; [MoI, Pg. 35] – Requires Con 3, level 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More essentia is essential for Incarnum charatcters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expanded Soulmeld Capacity [MoI, Pg. 38]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Invest more, but invest wisely! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cobalt Precision [MoI, Pg. 37]&amp;nbsp; – Requires Point Blank Shot, Con 13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  only Incarnum feat specifically for ranged characters is rather  underwhelming since it only provides a bonus to rolls to confirm ranged  criticals and the damage dealt.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Midnight Augmentation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;[MoI, Pg. 38] – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Requires Con 13, 2nd level powers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;Good for reducing power cost in a psionic build.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Midnight Metamagic&lt;/span&gt; [MoI, Pg. 39] – Requires Con 13, ability to cast 1st level spells, any metamagic feat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good choice if you plan on multiclassing into a spellcasting class. Persisting a spell could be quite valuable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Shape Soulmeld&lt;/span&gt; [MoI, Pg. 40] – Requires Con 13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See a soulmeld you like on some other class's list? Now it's yours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Split Chakra&lt;/span&gt; [MoI, Pg. 41] – No prerequisites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to have both magic items and a soulmeld? Not a problem&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Factotum Archers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NK-EZ2VimjE/WlsjurCGOhI/AAAAAAAABH8/96i6SGv2SVQQOC0o-IWP-RY9fO9ljqOQwCLcBGAs/s1600/Robin%2BHood.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;299&quot; data-original-width=&quot;592&quot; height=&quot;322&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NK-EZ2VimjE/WlsjurCGOhI/AAAAAAAABH8/96i6SGv2SVQQOC0o-IWP-RY9fO9ljqOQwCLcBGAs/s640/Robin%2BHood.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our arrows will blot out the sun.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;It should come as no surprise that the jack of all trades class can do archery as well. Although Factotums are not a martial class, they've got a few tricks up their sleeves to keep themselves competitive. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a Factotum Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The key to the Factotum uses for his combat effectiveness are his cunning plans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cunning Insight allows him to add his Intelligence modifier as a competence bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, or saving throws.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cunning Knowledge provides a bonus to Knowledge checks, which plays well with Knowledge Devotion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cunning Strike gives +1d6 Sneak Attack damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cunning Surge grants an extra standard action which can be used for Manyshot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cunning Brilliance lets him to emulate 3 class abilities available to a standard character at level 15 or lower.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;And let us not forget about their formidable linguistic capabilities! The Factotum is as cunning as a fox who has been appointed professor of Cunning at Oxford University!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The Factotum runs all these abilities off of Inspiration Points, so he must manage them wisely if he wishes to be an effective archer.

You're going to have to be careful of your race selection, as it affects your stats, feats, and what deities you can worship.It is noted that there are very few deities which both grant the War domain and have a longbow as their favored weapon. Fortunately, if your DM is open to using the Greek Pantheon, you can worship Athena, as she was historically the goddess of wisdom and military victory, known for her skill with the Bow and Arrow. This is reflected in her Deities and Demigods domains, which are Artifice, Community, Good, Knowledge, Law, and War.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;A regular Cleric can get the War domain and the Law domain to trade in for Law Devotion, while a Cloistered Cleric can trade in his additional Knowledge domain for Knowledge Devotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archivists [&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?page=3&amp;amp;x=dnd%2Fex%2F20051007a&quot;&gt;HoH&lt;/a&gt;] make an interesting choice for Divine Archers as well. Thir Dark Knowledge class feature compliments Knowldge Devotion, and the can cherrypick spells from all Divine spell lists, such as Hunter's Eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paladins can be built as archers, perhaps even as mounted archers to take advantage of the Paladin mount, but they do not have an easy way to obtain the feats necessary for ranged combat, nor do the rest of their class features or spells support it. That being said, on page 204 of the DMG,&amp;nbsp; the last bullet point under the &quot;Unusual Mounts&quot; section states that a Paladin can get a gold dragon as a mount. This is awesome and makes more sense than wielding a lance while riding a dragon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spirit Shaman and Favored Soul can both be built as Archers, but neither have access to the bonus feats, turning feats, or metamagic tricks found in this section. The Favored Soul can use the Cleric's spells, while the Spirit Shaman should consult the Shapeshift Archer section for spell suggestions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cleric Spells &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Divine Favor&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/divineFavor.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Luck bonus of&amp;nbsp;+  to attack and damage per 3 caster levels, max +3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Blessed Aim&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] –Grants you and allies a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guiding Light [SpC] – +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls for enemies illuminated by the light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Ice Slick&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Divine version of the Grease spell, which creates a 20 foot radius ice slick which enemies must balance on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Snow Shoes&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Provides a +10 foot enhancement bonus to movement speed, eliminates the need to make a Balance check or Reflex save to walk on ice and snow without slipping and falling, to avoid cracking ice, or to avoid falling through cracked ice, and eliminates trails on ice.

A ranged attack strategy works well with the arcanist's ranged spells and lack of hit points; moreover, you get to take direct advantage of buffing spells. Most spells are a standard action to cast and can't be used in conjunction with archery, but swift action spells can be used to compliment your archery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building an Arcane Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;They key thing to decide on is whether you want to be a spellcaster who plinks at the enemies or an archer who uses magic to enhance his archery. Given how feat intensive archery is, the latter route is preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class choice is critical. For example, Sorcerers get more spells per day, but require Charisma to cast spells, which is yet another stat to sink points into. The Wizard, on the other hand, casts off Intelligence which synergizes with Knowledge Devotion. And a Focused Specialist can get almost as many spells as a sorcerer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Duskblade is geared towards melee combat, but it can work for ranged combat as well, especially since it is Intelligence based like the wizard. There's a nice, simple option for arcane archers, though you may have to poach the occasional spell from the Sorcerer/Wizard spell list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Sorcerer/Wizard Spells&lt;/h3&gt;Level 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Arrow Mind&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; [SpC] – Immediate action.

In addition, since you know it's an illusion, you can see through a Shadow Fog Cloud while the enemy would have to succeed on their will save to realize it is an illusion, if they get to interact with it at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Polymorph &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/polymorph.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – You can turn into many useful forms with this, but there aren't many that are helpful to archers per-se. Thri-Keen are good for the stat bonuses, extra arms, and the Deflect Arrows racial bonus feat.

You should, so this is only useful for defense and mobility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Level 8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moment of Prescience [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/momentOfPrescience.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level (max +25) on one attack roll, opposed ability or skill check, or save.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Superior Invisibility&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Not only are you invisible, you are pretty much immune to detection spells aside from True Seeing!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Level 9&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Shapechange&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/shapechange.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Turn into differnt forms for fun and profit! The Arrow Demon is good, but the Chronotyryn [FF] is better. Two rounds worth of actions is nothing to sneeze at! If that's not an option, you can always go for the Choker [SRD], who gets an extra move or standard action each round.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Time Stop&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/timeStop.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – Not that useful for an archer, but you can use the time to prepare for combat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Arcane Strike&lt;/span&gt; [CW, Pg. 96] – BAB +4, ability to cast 3rd level Arcane spells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You sacrifice a spellslot to gain a bonus on all your attack rolls for 1 round equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, as well as extra damage equal to 1d4 points x the level of the spell sacrificed.

It discharges when it strikes the enemy, but must be used within 1 minute of being cast or else it dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Prestige Classes&lt;/h3&gt;Arcane Archer  [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneArcher.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;Base Attack Bonus: +6&lt;br /&gt;Race: Elf (or) or Half-Elf&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow or shortbow)&lt;br /&gt;Spells: Ability to cast 1st level arcane spells. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one everyone thinks of. &lt;b&gt;The &lt;/b&gt;Arcane  Archer. How does it do? Not that great. Its is geared towards martial  characters who are light on the spellcasting; it grants full BAB, but  does not offer spellcasting progression. Furthermore, you have to be an  elf or half-elf. Elves generally get a penalty to Constitution, and the  races that don't get penalties to Strength or Intelligence, all of which  you may need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abilities are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Enhance Arrow&lt;/span&gt; – Grants a +1 enhancement bonus to the Arcane Archer's arrows, with an additional +1 for ever 2 levels above 1st.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Imbue Arrow&lt;/span&gt; – This is what most people are interested in when they take this  class. The second level ability lets you put an Area of Effect spells  in the arrow that is then centered where the arrow lands, even if the  spell would normally be centered on yourself, such as Antimagic Field.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Seeker Arrow&lt;/span&gt; – At 4th level, you may launch an arrow that seeks out a  known target within its range as long as there is no unavoidable  obstacle. It is limited by the fact that you may only do this once per  day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Phase Arrow&lt;/span&gt; – At 6th level, you can shoot an arrow that goes through nonmagical barriers. Once per day, again.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Hail of Arrows&lt;/span&gt; – At 8th level, you can give up your regular attacks to launch one  arrow at each enemy within range, capped by your Arcane Archer level.  This is worse than using your full attack. Once per day, thank God. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Arrow of Death&lt;/span&gt; – At 10th level, you can launch an Arrow of Death at an enemy which  forces a DC 20 Fortitude save against ddeath. This arrow takes one day  to craft, lasts for one year, and you cannot have more than on eat a  time. This is extra useless.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Judgement: This is only really worth taking up to level 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eldritch Knight [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/eldritchKnight.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;Proficiency with all martial weapons&lt;br /&gt;Must be able to cast 3rd level Arcane spells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  class grants Full BAB and 9/10th spellcasting progression. The first  level does not grant casting, but does give a Fighter bonus feat. It's fine as a filler, but rather boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knight Phantom [FN]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Ride 4 ranks&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Still Spell&lt;br /&gt;Proficiency in all martial weapons.&lt;br /&gt;Ability to cast phantom steed.&lt;br /&gt;Special: Citizen of Aundair, member of the Order of the Knights Arcane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Knight Phantom is a full BAB, 9/10th casting class much like the Eldritch Knight. Instead of a bonus feat, it grants:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Phantom Steed&lt;/span&gt; – A 1st level Knight Phantom can summon a Phantom  Steed a number of times per day equal to his Knight Phantom level. His  levels of Knight Phantom stack with those of his highest arcane  spellcasting class for determining the caster level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Somatic Prowess&lt;/span&gt; – A 1st level Knight Phantom learns to cast spells in light armor. Handy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspect of the Phantom – At 4th level, a Knight Phantom gets to hover  above the ground and walk on water a number of rounds equal to his  Knight Phantom levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Countenance of the Phantom – At 7th level, a Knight Phantom gains  concealment with a 20% miss chance for a number of rounds equal&amp;nbsp; to his  Knight Phantom level. He can also cause each creature within 10 feet of  him to become shaken unless they pass a will save, but the DC is 10 +  his class level + his Charisma modifier, and enemies will likely be  immune to fear effects at that level anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;Blade of the Phantom&lt;/span&gt; – At 10th level, a Knight Phantom can give a melee weapon the Brilliant  Energy property for a number of rounds per day equal to his Knight  Phantom level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Judgement: Good at first level. There's nothing wrong with  continuing on to progress BAB and spellcasting if you have nothing  better to do, but it's not great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Inspiring Archers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0fVdELYPPz0/WlwW_xz6rfI/AAAAAAAABJQ/dCNflGIIUAUu3OGpzzXYfOYbqKEpgP3TwCLcBGAs/s1600/Bardic%2BArcher.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;479&quot; data-original-width=&quot;735&quot; height=&quot;416&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0fVdELYPPz0/WlwW_xz6rfI/AAAAAAAABJQ/dCNflGIIUAUu3OGpzzXYfOYbqKEpgP3TwCLcBGAs/s640/Bardic%2BArcher.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;At one hundred yards, volley fire present!

What if we build an archer whose emphasis was on supporting the rest of the party while they fight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building an Inspiring Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As far as support classes go, the one most suited for an Inspiring Archer is the Bard due to Inspire Courage, which can provide substantial bonuses to attack and damge rolls. The Bard only gets shortbow proficiency, so he will have to either multiclass or spend a feat to access a better weapon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Fortunately, the Marshal [&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ex/20030906b&quot;&gt;MinH&lt;/a&gt;] is a martial support class that is proficient with all martial weapons, grants the useful Skill Focus: Diplomacy feat, and a minor aura which applies a circumstance bonus equal to the Marshal's Charisma bonus to various checks and rollls. A popular choice is the Motivate Dexterity Aura for a bonus to Dexterity checks, Dexterity based skill checks, and initiative checks. Not only does the Marshal's supurb leadership and impeccable orders result in his team going first in combat, but he can even make his teammates more stealthy by yelling at them!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;This pairs well with the Bard's Mimicking Song ACF [DS] which replaces the Inspire Competence bonus with a +2 bonus to Move Silently checks for all allies within 30 feet. Your team can literally sing and dance their way into an enemy stronghold to conduct ambushes. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dictummortuum.blogspot.com/2017/11/black-jack-wellesley-dread-pirate-king.html&quot;&gt;But more on that elsewhere.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The next level gets you a Major Aura, one of which grants a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls, and a third level grants you another Minor Aura. You could select Motivate Intelligence to gain a bonus to Knowledge Devotion checks, or Motivate Charisma for social fun, but you've lost out on two levels of Bard spellcasting, Bardic Music, and skill points.&amp;nbsp; This is probably as far as you want to go as a Marshal, and that's only if you really, really want that second aura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bard Spells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Grease &lt;/span&gt;[&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/grease.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] – It renders enemies prone and flat-footed if they balance on it without 5 ranks in balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focusing Chant [SpC] – Grants a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 minute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Improvisation&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – You gain a floating pool of luck points which can be used to improve attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Works well with Knowledge Devotion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Inspirational Boost&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Swift action. Increases the bonus of your Inspire Courage by 1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Targeting Ray [SpC] – Ranged touch attack gives you and your allies a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls/3 caster levels for the duration of the spell. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Level 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Alter Self&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; [SRD] – Like the Arcane Archer, you can get a great deal of mileage out of this. Perhaps more, since you will have social skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Glitterdust &lt;/span&gt;[SRD] – You need to have a way to detect invisible opponents since your don't get See Invisibility until later. The debuff is also nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Invisibility &lt;/span&gt;[SRD] – You have the skills for sneaking, making this a great choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Pyrotechnics &lt;/span&gt;[SRD] – Notable because it is a long range spell. You can blind a small army with this and then pepper them from a distance while they are helpless to return fire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Fly, Swift &lt;/span&gt;[SpC] – Lets you fly for 1 round.

Mentioned because it grants a luck bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to fortitude, reflex, or will saves (your choice.).

Useful in general and incredible in an aquatic environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Level 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dimension Jumper [CM] – Swift action.

Another candidate for Heroics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Melodic Casting&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; [CM, Pg. 44] – Requires Perform 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, Bardic Music class feature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt;This lets you substitute a Perform check for a Concentration check when casting spells.

Not only does it gain bonus feats, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psm/20070214a&quot;&gt;The Mind's Eye Web Enhancement&lt;/a&gt; granted it two alternative class features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mantled  Warrior: Loses the Psychic Warrior's 2nd level bonus feat in exchange  for learning one of the Ardent's mantles and gaining the mantle ability. The mantles most suitable for archery are:&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Freedom &lt;/span&gt;for the&amp;nbsp;+10 ft bonus to movement speed when psionically focused and access toof mobility powers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Knowledge&lt;/span&gt; for the ability to discharge your psionic focus for a&amp;nbsp;+5 to Knowledge checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might for the bonus power points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Time &lt;/span&gt;for the +2 bonus to initiative and access to Anticipatory Strike, which allows you to take a turn as an immediate action.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soulbound  Weapon: Trades the 2nd level bonus feat for the the ability to call a  Soulbound Weapon and the Weapon Focus feat for that weapon.Your first  level power must be Call Weaponry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From now on, you may use  the Call Weaponry power to summon your Soulbound Weapon, which gains a  +1 enhancement bonus for every 4 manifester levels you possess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In addition, you may augment Call Weaponry: for each additional 5 power points you spend, you may add a weapon  enhancement of +1 value to the weapon. This offers a great amount of flexibility in your choice of weapon enhancements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The second is the Ardent. It is a very flexible class with a rotating selection of mantles, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/psm/20070629a&quot;&gt;The Mind's Eye&lt;/a&gt; gave it two great alternative class features as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Dominant Ideal&lt;/span&gt; causes you to lose the mantle you get at 10th level. In return, you pick a mantle whose powers you can apply metapsionic feats to without expending your focus, and it reduces the cost of applying metapsionic feats by 2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Time &lt;/span&gt;mantle would be great for this. Your other mantle should be the &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Freedom&lt;/span&gt; mantle for mobility.

This only works if you are aware of the attack and not flat-footed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Prestige Classes&lt;/h3&gt;Slayer [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/prestigeClasses/slayer.htm&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;BAB +4&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Knowledge (Dungeoneering) 4 ranks&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Track&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This turns you into an Ranger, with extra bonuses against a type of Psionic creature of your choice.. Not terribly useful outside of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Soulbow&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/ex/20060403a&amp;amp;page=2&quot;&gt;CP&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;Skills: Autohypnosis 8 ranks.&lt;br /&gt;Feats: Point Blank Shot.&lt;br /&gt;Special: Throw mind blade class feature.&lt;br /&gt;This prestige class redeems the Soulknife completely by giving it combat abilities that are both viable and awesome:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Bonus feats&lt;span style=&quot;color: black;&quot;&gt; –&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You get one at odd levels, which must come from a list of archery related feats. The prestige class explicitly notes that DMs should expand the list based on the material available in the game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Mind Arrows&lt;/span&gt; – These are basically a new shape for your Mind Blade, except that they behave as if they were shot out of a composite longbow. The damage is based on your Wisdom modifier. With Zen Archery, both attack and damage key off of Wisdom!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Mind Arrow Enhancements –&lt;/span&gt; Not only do you get enhancement bonuses, you can also get weapon properties, including the &lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Lucky&lt;/span&gt; property which is not normally found on ranged weapons! Enyour your free reroll with every attack! Do ya' feel lucky, punk? Well do ya'?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Close Combat Shot&lt;/span&gt; – You can shoot people without incurring attacks of opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phase Arrow – This one's pretty bad, but it has no cap on uses, so it's still better than the Arcane Archer's version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;As a bonus, you can also wield a shield for extra protection. This prestige class offers everything an archer could want.  Since there's no need to go all in with Soulknife levels, I recommend dipping two levels into Ranger for Rapid Shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Shapechaning Archers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tQd-gv2hUEg/Wlxwpx8o5EI/AAAAAAAABJ8/-C0QeXGWr20VnjyiqYASa6U3XwElxTwZgCLcBGAs/s1600/Shapechanging%2BArcher.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;465&quot; data-original-width=&quot;745&quot; height=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tQd-gv2hUEg/Wlxwpx8o5EI/AAAAAAAABJ8/-C0QeXGWr20VnjyiqYASa6U3XwElxTwZgCLcBGAs/s640/Shapechanging%2BArcher.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Take your strinking paws off of me!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;The ability to shapeshift into various forms offers characters a grat deal of versatility, but this applies more to melee combat than to archery. Most bows to not automatically adjust for changing strength, and most forms do not offer special bonuses for archery – if, indeed, they have the opposible thumbs needed for wielding bows and arrows in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Building a Shapeshift Archer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The Wild Shape Ranger [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/variantCharacterClasses.htm#ranger&quot;&gt;SRD&lt;/a&gt;] trades in his Combat Style for Wild Shape for small and medium animals. The Baboon is the most likely to be able to use a bow without the DM objecting, but this doesn't offer much improvement over a regular archer outside of its climb speed. The Master of Many Forms prestige class opens up more options for Wild Shape forms such as giants, monstrous humanoids, fety, etc, though none of them seem particularly suited for archery.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;The Druid is in the same boat as the Wild Shape Ranger, except he has less BAB and more spellcasting. While the Druid does have many battlefield control spells, making a battlefield control druid is beyond the scope of this guide. Offhand, I can recommend the Obscuring Snow. [Frost] and Snowsight [Frost] spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Both classes get Animal Companions, which opens up the possibility of Mounted Combat. But at that point, you're probably not shapeshifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Spells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There aren't many good spells for the archer Druid in core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/span&gt; (1st) outlines enemies and negates concealment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Longstrider&lt;/span&gt; (1st) lets you move faster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Shapechange&lt;/span&gt; (1st) lets you exploit the same forms as the Arcane Archer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Druids get some more archery support outside of core, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – 1st level spell. increases the range increment for ranged weapons you wield by 50%, and grants&amp;nbsp; +5 competence bonus on Spot checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Snowshoes&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Handy for the movement bonus and ability to avoid ice hazards. Strictly superior to Longstrider. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Master Air&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – 2ndl evel spell. Allows you to fly at decent speed with good maneuverability, but it doesn't last long.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Fly, Swift&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – 3rd level. Druids get this too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Owl's Insight &lt;/span&gt;[SpC] – 5th level. Subject gains enhancement bonus to Wisdom equal to half your caster level. Works well with Zen Archery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siren's Grace [SpC] – 5th level. Druids don't benefit from the Charisma boost or Charisma to AC, but it still lets them swim, breathe in water, and use ranged weapons underwater.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Wind Tunnel&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – 5th level. Grants you and your allies a +5 competence bonus to hit and doubles the range incriment of ranged weapons. You could make a pretty good Druid sniper with this and Hawkeye!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ranger gets a few spells out of core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Arrow Mind&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Immediate action. A 1st level spell that let the caster threaten squares within  their normal melee reach and avoid provoking Attacks of Opportunity when  shooting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;Guided Shot&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Swift action. A 1st level spell that lets you ignore range penalties due to distance and the AC bonus of any cover shot of total cover, and the miss chance granted by concealment less than total concealment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – 1st level  spell. increases the range increment for ranged weapons you wield by  50%, and grants&amp;nbsp; +5 competence bonus on Spot checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hunter's Mercy [SpC] – Your next attack with a bow (not including crossbows) is an automatic critical hit. Must be used before the end of your next turn. As this is a standard action to cast, that makes it difficult to use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Sniper's Shot&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Swift action. 1st level spell that removes the distance limit on ranged Sneak Attacks for one round.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Snowshoes&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Handy for the movement bonus and ability to avoid ice hazards. Strictly superior to Longstrider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Exacting Shot&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Swift action. 2nd level spell automatically confirms critical hits against favored enemies and ignores concealment less than total concealment..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Haste, Swift&lt;/span&gt; [SpC] – Swift action. 2nd level spell which grants a personal Haste for 1d4 rounds. Not bad. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;Hunter's Eye&lt;/span&gt; [PHBII] – Swift action.

I'll try to cover everything in as comprehensive a fashion as possible, but since I'm not just copying the handbook the process will probably take a while. The thread will be mostly practical optimization so all the advice presented will be aimed with campaigns and playability in mind; records are one thing, but practically being able to shoot 40000' away isn't going to come up very often in campaigns. I will cover the tricks to pump one's range, but I won't be making builds with the sole intention of shooting damn far.–EldarielI am editing and completing this handbook as of November 2017.-SoloTable of ContentsRatingsSource Legend GeneralOverview of Archery Styles:Traditional ArcheryCrossbow ArcheryMounted ArcheryClass Specifics:Martial Archers [Fighters, Rangers et co.]Skirmish Archers [Scouts, Swift Hunters et co.]Precision Archers [Rogues, Ninjas, et co.]Sublime Way Archers [Tome of Battle]Incarnum Archers [Magic of Incarnum]Factotum Archers [Manyshot Builds]Divine Archers [Cleric, Archivist et co.]Arcane Archers [Gish, Arcane Archer et co.]Inspiring Archers [Bards]Psionic Archers [Ardents, Psychic Warriors et co.]Shapechanging Archers [Druids et co.]RatingsRed options are rated as bad, and should by and large be avoided.Black options are average and probably have specific niches or are good options in the absence of others, but are nothing special.Blue options are good options and if they happen to sync with what your character is doing, you should probably pick them up.Purple options are godlike; these are the cream of the crop and if you can, you should be picking them up.Source Legend Not all of the sources are used in the present guide; the listed abbreviation is what I'll be using should I happen to add material.Code:AE = Arms and Equipment Guide (3.0)BoED = Book of Exalted DeedsBoVD = Book of Vile Darkness (3.0)CA = Complete ArcanaCAdv = Complete AdventurerCC = Complete ChampionCD = Complete DivineCM = Complete MageCP = Complete PsionicCS = Complete ScoundrelCW = Complete WarriorCoR = Champions of RuinCoV = Champions of ValorCity = CityscapeDC = Dragon CompendiumDM = Dragon MagicDMG = Dungeon Master's GuideDMGII = Dungeon Master's Guide 2DotU = Drow of the UnderdarkDR### = Dragon Magazine Issue ###Drac = DraconomiconDS = DungeonscapeECS = Eberron Campaign SettingsFN = Five NationsFrost = FrostburnFRCS = Forgotten Realms Campaign Settings (3.0)LoM = Lords of MadnessMinH = Miniatures HandbookMIC = Magic Item CompendiumMM = Monster ManualMMII = Monster Manual II (3.0)MMIII = Monster Manual IIIMMIV = Monster Manual IVMMV = Monster Manual VMoF = Magic of Faerûn (3.0)MoI = Magic of IncarnumMotW = Masters of the Wild (3.0)PF SRD = Pathfinder System Reference Document [All game rules for Pathfinder]PGtF = Player's Guide to FaerûnPGtE = Player's Guide to EberronPHB = Player's HandbookPHBII = Player's Handbook 2PlHB = Planar HandbookPoF = Powers of FaerûnRoD = Races of DestinyRotD = Races of the DragonRoE = Races of EberronRoF = Races of Faerûn (3.0)RoS = Races of StoneRotW = Races of the WildSand = SandstormSoS = Secrets of SarlonaSoX = Secrets of Xen'drikSC = Spell CompendiumS&amp;amp;F = Sword and Fist (3.0)SM = Silver Marshes (3.0)SS = Savage Species (3.0)SRD = System Reference Document [All game rules from 3.5 PHB, DMG, MM, XPH and some parts of UA]ToB = Tome of BattleToM = Tome of MagicUA = Unearthed ArcanaUnd = Underdark (3.0)XPH = Expanded Psionics HandbookGeneralArchers by RangeArchery is a pretty large umbrella for a form of attacks, so a bit more accurate separation will help with dealing with particular builds and the capabilities we'll be looking for in each category. Archery is easiest divided to range categories:Point Blank Range [Up to 30']This is the range for Point Blank Shot, Manyshot and the range limitation for most sorts of Precision Damage. The common Swift Hunter Archer is going to want to visit this range quite often and this is also the range for a normal Rogue to Sneak Attack. This is also the standard move action, so acting at this range is almost as dangerous as fighting in melee.Extended Point Blank Range [Up to 60']This is the range for Precision Damage Dealers with range extending feats, such as a Swift Hunter with Ranged Skirmisher. If you can move after attack, this range gives you relative safety and alpha strike capability as an average movement speed of 30' cannot charge beyond 60'. This is generally also the maximum range you'll have to deal with in dungeons.Long Range [Up to ~300']This is generally one-two increments away and a range where normal characters can still succeed their spot checks, so a good range to start an encounter at for a non-Precision Damage Archer in wilderness areas. At this range, you can generally pepper the opponent with a few full attacks before they close in to casting/melee range and free damage never hurt anyone. Most Cleric Archers and other non-Fighter Archers tend to operate at this range.Extreme Range [~300' upwards]To effectively act at such a range, you tend to need uncanny means of detecting opponents, be it ridiculously high spot check or some divination magic/spotter, and very high attack bonuses or long range increments to act effectively. A Fighter Archer with Ranged Weapon Mastery, Dragonbone Bow, Far Shot/Distance-weapon and levels in Cragtop Archer can probably still act effectively given the means to detect opponents, but usually it already starts to take effort and specialization to function at such a range. High attack bonuses help too, of course.As for a breakdown for the class specifics: The Swift Hunter-section will obviously be for the short ranges. Sneak Attacking Archers mostly deal with Extended Point Blank Range. A majority of the guide will deal with Long Range (all non-Precision characters). At least the martial section will be touching upon Archers geared for Extreme Ranges (due to terrain and spot difficulties, such ranges are usually impractical so it's not the primary focus).The Archer as a CombatantThe largest challenge an archer tends to face is damage. Since archers generally key their damage off a different attribute than their To Hit, they can't solely focus on one or the other, and since Power Attack hasn't been printed within 3.5 rules for ranged weapons (see Hank's Energy Bow though, as well as the Deadly Aim feat and the Peerless Archer prestige class), archers tend to have a lot of difficulty dealing damage comparable to effective melee combatants.Since archery generally doesn't lend itself very well to controlling the battlefield, most archers should focus on dealing enough damage to warrant their position in the party. Of course, depending on the class, the archer will fill secondary functions like the Divine Caster, the Skill Monkey, the Arcane Caster or such, but if you want to do archery, you should do it well enough to actually make shooting arrows worth your time. This means that dealing damage is an important hurdle to overcome. The specific means for pumping up damage will be covered separately in each section, and this is indeed the main point that requires optimization when it comes to archery.The biggest advantage archers have, of course, is functioning at a range. Archers can easily guarantee full attacks simply because it doesn't really matter where the opponent is as long as you have line of effect; and few creatures are able to retaliate from 1000' away so there's something to be said about nuking someone in the horizon. Archers have lots of options that only work at short ranges which of course sucks far as utilizing their biggest advantage goes; as such, anything that requires being within 30' of opponent should be considered twice, and likewise ways to extend your operational range if you have such limitations should be a high priority so that you're more than just a sub-par pseudo-melee damage dealer.Archery has a few more ways to generate extra attacks than melee making effects that can be applied on each hit comparatively more worthwhile to an archer than to a melee type. This is important especially with feats, spells &amp;amp; class features granting flat damage bonuses and with magic weapons. Archers benefit of those comparatively more than most other types of warriors. The magic weapon benefits are further expanded by the option of placing separate, situational enhancements on arrows/bolts at a low price and being able to whip them out when you actually face opponents vulnerable to those Bane-arrows you bought or whatever; most efficient way of using opposition-specific weapon enhancements in the game, really.FeatsRegardless of what kind of archery you're going for, it will be feat intensive. It's almost as bad as Two-Weapon Fighting in that regard, and that's saying a lot. This especially hurts otherwise solid archery-classes like Cleric that would want to pick up other feats too, but are generally spending 3+ feats on archery just to get the basic archery ability. Beyond the base 3 feats, archers can pick up a lot of useful abilities through extra feats, and thus archery lends itself pretty well to feat heavy classes – a 2-level Fighter dip is often solid for non-spellcasting builds. In this chapter, I'll break the feats down by Archery Archetype since I cannot really do that in the other sections; Archery Archetypes kind of supersede the exact build.General Archery FeatsPoint Blank Shot [SRD] – No prerequisitesThe feat sucks, but it's a prerequisite for practically everything archery.Precise Shot [SRD] – Requires Point Blank ShotWithout this, you'll be peppering your allies in melee or alternatively cannot use archery as your main tactic after the combat is joined. This is also a requirement to utilize the best equipment-based buff for archery, Splitting [CoR Pg. 42], so if you've got access to Splitting, this is an absolute must.Sharp-Shooting&amp;nbsp;[CWar, Pg. 105] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +3This feat has very few uses; mostly it's just one of those &quot;My Fighter had too many feats and doesn't qualify for Improved Precise Shot yet so he picked this to be retrained later&quot;-feats, and quite frankly, optimized Fighters don't have too many feats. So what it does – it halves the AC-bonus standard cover gives opponents. That's it. It doesn't help against opponents behind a tree, with concealment and it doesn't even remove the Cover-bonus.You're still better off looking for clear shots than shooting through cover, so effectively you spent a feat to make an unfavorable situation slightly less unfavorable, but still one you don't want to be in. Congratulations. Oh yeah, and this doesn't help the standard problem of not dealing sufficient damage at all.Improved Precise Shot [SRD] – Requires Dex 19, Precise Shot, Point Blank Shot, BAB +12Hitting into Grapple is handy, although by the time you get this, you'll mostly have Freedom of Movement available anyways along with swift action teleportation, so this ability won't be as helpful as it could possibly be earlier. Much more important though is the ability to ignore all but total concealment and cover. This opens up some interesting uses with some spells (basically anything that grants lesser degrees of concealment) and items such as Eversmoking Bottle, causing one-sided miss chance. It's also fun to be able to shoot through that keyhole with 100% accuracy. Overall, a handy feat if not &quot;OMG MUST HAVE&quot;-material. Steep requirements though; not available to Zen Archers and +12 BAB means it comes very late for everyone. It's the Be All-End All feat for hitting though, ignoring just about any obstacles but solid walls and complete darkness.Woodland Archer [RotW Pg. 154] – Requires Point Blank Shot, +6 BABThe tactical feat is handy for snipers, but the true power is the first ability for the volley archers. Adjust for Range: Volley archers love this one; the more attacks, the better. The volley types with maximized number of attacks can often be hitting ACs over 100 easily towards the last ~10 shots or so, so it's solid 400-500 damage to opponents at AC 100. Pierce the Foliage: The second option allows ignoring all concealment including total concealment giving you a strong tool against invisibility and similar abilities, while also making up for Improved Precise Shot for those builds that can't afford picking up Improved Precise Shot, and for those looking to pick it up later Moving Sniper: Finally, the third option is great for snipers; being able to move while sniping makes it easier to avoid being located, and also to keep the distance you want between shots.Far Shot [SRD] – Requires Point Blank ShotThis allows you to shoot further than everyone else. Frankly, it isn't worth a feat as such long-range combat isn't all that commonplace and you can gain this ability magically (through the Distance-enhancement on arrows) for when you need to shoot at faraway targets. This isn't worth a feat (except for qualifying purposes), but this does warrant inclusion on a bunch of arrows.Zen Archery [CW Pg. 106] – Requires Wis 13, BAB +1If you are making a Wisdom-based character dumping Dex, this is a must. It's the Weapon Finesse of Ranged Weapons. Clerics, Druids and generally Wisdom-based casters are the most likely subjects, although some martial Wisdom-based classes might also end up in a situation where this is optimalDeadly Aim [PF SRD] – Requires Dex 13, BAB +1This is basically Ranged Power Attack; PF Power Attack, but still Power Attack. Of course, the catch is it's from Pathfinder, not actual 3.X. Still, anyone building an Archer would do well to at least ask if this were available; PF material is backwards compatible and this gives archers something they sorely need. There's a ton of ways to buff ranged To Hit but 3.X offers literally no efficient ways of converting all the extra To Hit to damage, and no efficient means of buffing damage only in general. If you can, take this.Clustered Shots [PF SRD] – Requires Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +6.Another Pathfinder feat, this one allows you to use a full-attack action to total all the damage you inflict on a target before damage reduction is applied. Handy if you don't happen to have a Force arrow handyRanged Disarm [CW Pg. 103] – Requires Dex 15, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +5This allows you to make Disarm-attempts with ranged weapons at the range of 30'. Unfortunately, the limit of point blank range makes it much worse than just using a two-handed weapon such as Spiked Chain, giving you bonuses to the Disarm-attempt. Further, Disarming is a rather weak strategy in the first place due to the existence of items such as Locked Gauntlets making it just useless, and the fact that many monsters fight with natural weapons, which aren't very disarmable. Extra options are nice, butDisarming isn't usually worth the trouble. Still, seeing that we're talking about an opposed attack roll here, I could see some implications in some campaigns. Generally you just won't have the feats to burn though. Note that this feat gains no benefit of the Improved Disarm-feat.Ranged Sunder [CW Pg. 104] – Requires Str 13, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +5This allows you to make Sunder-attempts with ranged weapons at the range of 30'. Again, it's annoying to only be able to use it at point blank range, and further annoying that Piercing Ranged Weapons only deal ½ damage even with this feat. Serpenttongue Arrows could help there though. I could definitely see implications for this feat, but often you don't want to Sunder opponent's weapons simply because they're loot. Still, it also works against objects, and it can be handy in arena settings so I wouldn't consider it entirely useless. Generally you can't afford the feat for this though. Note that this feat isn't helped by Improved Sunder-feat.Ranged Pin [CW Pg. 103] – Requires Dex 15, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +5This is my favorite of the three; this allows you to make ranged Grapple-checks. You need to beat opponent's AC, and then you get to make Grapple-checks provided that opponent is close to a surface (such as the floor when flying overhead). If you do manage to win the Grapple-check, they are considered Grappled until they succeed DC 15 Strength- or Escape Artist-check as a Standard Action. Therefore, they'll at least waste a turn, and it requires no actions whatsoever from you.This is quite handy for archers focusing on Strength for damage (as while you don't get Improved Grapple-benefits, Strength-modifier and Size-modifier apply as normal), giving you extra tools against certain archetypes (such as an easy way to keep casters in AMF; Arcane Archer shooting an AMF with Imbue Arrow, using the arrow to Grapple the target would pretty much one-hit KO a caster at any range). This really works the better, the bigger you are as the bonuses are hard to come by. Overall though, there are many implications for this – very handy to keep Melee away.Sense Weakness [Drac Pg. 106] – Requires Int 13, Combat Expertise, Weapon Focus (any)When attacking with the weapon you have Weapon Focus in, you can ignore up to 5 points of Damage Reduction. While this annoyingly requires Combat Expertise that is rather wasted for you, this is one of the few mundane means of fighting Damage Reduction with a bow. And Damage Reduction is a huge hurdle for an archer whose damage tends to be based on a large number of attacks. In an environment without Force, or other magical ways to ignore DR, I'd definitely strongly consider this if I had the feats to burn (and was going for Ranged Weapon Mastery anyways; that basically gets you Weapon Focus for free).Dead Eye [DC Pg. 95, DR304 Pg. 84] – Requires Dex 17, Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus, BAB +14 (DR304 is Dex 13, BAB +1)This adds Dexterity to your damage within 30' as precision damage. Dragon Magazine #304 only had Dex 13 and BAB +1 requirement, which obviously made the feat much better. As it stands, it's quite situational; while your Dex is probably massive and thus the damage bonus is massive, the limitation in the range and the fact that many enemies are probably immune and there are no easy ways to bypass these immunities, unlike with Sneak Attack or Skirmish, makes it far less amazing than it would be otherwise. It's worth considering but if you can get the damage from more reliable sources, do so.Shot on the Run [SRD] – Requires Dex 13, Point Blank Shot, Dodge, Mobility, BAB +4The effect is handy... but then you look at the prerequisites! Two useless feats. And what it gets you? You get to move before and after an attack. That means it doesn't work with Order of the Bow Initiate's Precise Shot, Manyshot, Penetrating Shot or really anything else for that matter. Basically, the base idea is good, but the feat has worthless prerequisites and is mistemplated for use with the abilities that could utilize it. Stay away, unless you can talk your DM into allowing Standard Action-effects including Ranged Attack instead of just a Ranged Attack between the movements; Manyshot would be useful with this, but one shot? Not so much.Flyby Attack [SRD] – Requires Fly speedThis is the feat Shot on the Run, Spring Attack, and company always wanted to be! This is the be-all end-all movement feat, but it requires Fly speed so it isn't available for all PCs. In fact, mostly it's available for Dragonborn, Raptorans and characters picking feats to get Wings (along with possibly casters with magical flight). Though if you can get it with item-based qualifications, give it a good hard look. It enables you to move, Manyshot and retreat in the same round. It also works with Penetrating Shot, spellcasting and so on; basically the perfect tool for getting in range for Precision-attack and getting outside opponent's effective range for your own turn. Skirmisher's feat, though archery is notoriously reliant on its full attacks, and its primary advantage over other combat styles is getting them consistently and reliably. Volley Archery FeatsRapid Shot [SRD] – Requires Dex 13, Point Blank ShotThe Dex requirement can be problematic for Wisdom-based archers, but that extra attack goes a long way towards making archery worth your time. I'd snag this if at all possible and consider pumping my Dex just to get it. The extra attack is probably going to do more damage on average than an extra point of Strength.Improved Rapid Shot [CW Pg. 101] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Rapid Shot, ManyshotUnfortunately Manyshot isn't a very good feat for volley archers (it is occasionally useful though; extra options are always good) and likewise, Manyshotters don't want Improved Rapid Shot. That fact bringing this feat down in value by having a semi-wasted prerequisite either way. Rangers do get Manyshot as a bonus though and Fighters get enough feats to pick it up, and two extra points for hitting is nothing to scoff at, especially on higher levels with a number of iteratives. Not a must have, but handy.Knowledge Devotion [CC Pg. 60] – Requires Knowledge (any): 5 ranksOne of the best feats for boosting the damage output in archery. If you have the feats to burn for Education [ECS Pg. 52, PGtF Pg. 38] along with some skillpoints and Int-modifier, you can cover all Knowledges used for identifying creatures (Arcana, Dungeoneering, Local, Nature, Religion, The Planes) adequately and be the party Knowledge Bank while at it. Even just one rank in all Knowledges gets you at least +1/+1 for all combats with the potential for +2/+2 on decent rolls. Oh yeah, the free Knowledge as a class skill regardless of your multiclassing doesn't hurt either. Pairs well with the Collector of Stories skill trick for a +5 to identifying creatures!Plunging Shot [RoTW Pg. 152] – Requires Dex 13, Point Blank ShotGet extra 1d6 damage on targets 30' below you. At first glance, this feat appears awesome. Once you start thinking about it though, it appears increasingly bad. First of all, this practically means you'll need to be in the air. 30' is either a cliff overseeing the opponent's position or simply flight and of those, flight should be a more common option. Therefore, it gives you an advantage when you can fly and your opponent can't. Seems good, except if that's the case, your opponent isn't exactly the most dire of threats in the first place, except when talking about another archer. So it's decent in archery duels where you invested in flight and opponent didn't and that's pretty much it. Second, the feat is simply unusable in lots of locales. Good luck getting 30' up in a dungeon. Same goes to pretty much any building. So the feat has a powerful effect, but unfortunately it's way too situational to truly be worth a feat slot in most cases.Hiding and Sniping FeatsDarkstalker [LoM Pg. 179] – No prerequisitesIf you're planning on sniping, Hide is your primary tool. Normally this is a poor idea since a vast number of creatures completely ignore Hide with their alternate senses. Darkstalker though means that any creature needs to make Spot-checks vs. you. This is an immense advantage and if you do plan on sniping a lot, this feat is an absolute must. In fact, if you plan on Hiding a lot, this is an absolute must. The only problem is that the source is somewhat obscure.Able Sniper [RotW Pg. 148] – Requires Dex 13, Hide: 5 ranksYou get bonuses to hitting flat-footed opponents, and more importantly +4 to Hide-checks made to hide afterward. If you're going Sniping, this is probably the feat to start with; hitting with Snipes and staying hidden go a long way to keeping you alive. There's one unfortunate drawback here, and it's the fact that you only get bonuses to hit against opponents that are at least 30' away. That makes triggering Sneak Attack difficult as you need the opponent at exactly 30' for that, or alternatively you need some way to extend Sneak Attack-range (such as Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77] – as the name suggests though, that's only for crossbow snipers).Concealed Ambush [DR339 Pg. 87] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Hide: 10 ranks, Move Silently: 10 ranksLots of prerequisites, but you'll have those all as a sniper anyways. This one is quite good. When sniping, you only take -10 on the Hide-check to Hide again. That's effectively +10 to your Hide-checks for this purpose. It's a very limited feat, but if I was making a Sniper, I'd make sure to try hard to fit this if Dragon is allowed.Bowslinger [Und Pg. 24] – Requires BAB +1This gives you +2 on attacks against Flat-Footed opponents. Again handy for making sure you hit, but I don't find this worth a feat; something to pick up with an Action Point when you feel you need the extra accuracy, perhaps. If it helped in Hiding, it could be worth actually picking, but as it stands...Penetrating Shot [PHBII Pg. 81] – Requires Str 15, Point Blank Shot, BAB +10Gives you the ability to shoot through opponents in a 60' line as a Standard Action. This could be somewhat useful as since it's a Standard Action, you've got the Move left to Hide with. So this is a bonus to a Sniper, but lined up opponents are relatively rare. Still, it may just be worth it, especially with Woodland Archer to shift position to get the lines right.Weapon Enhancement Improving FeatsMercantile Background&amp;nbsp;[FRCS Pg. 36, PGtF Pg. 41] – 1st Level Only, Location RequirementsThis feat is a doozy. You get 75% for items you sell and once per month, can purchase something for 75% listed price. Also, you start with extra money – level 1 Composite Longbow with Str Bonus FTW! So yea, this helps you afford a damn good bow. And your party will love you. You can easily be multiple enhancements beyond the normal with this.This can of course be combined with crafting or other sources of items such as crafting to essentially go infinite as a merchant. Capitalism FTW!Ancestral Relic [BoED Pg. 39] – Any Good alignment, Character Level 3rdBasically, this feat allows you to spend items for their full price when enhancing your ancestral relic. In this case, you'll of course want an ancestral weapon. This is a strong alternative to Mercantile Background, but while the feat is not Exalted, it does require Good alignment which is something to keep in mind. There's also a limit on how much you can spend on the feat. Mercantile Background is stronger overall but if you want specifically a stronger weapon, this does have the higher ratio.Item Familiar [UA Pg. 170] – Character Level 3rdMake your Bow your Item Familiar. You'll be able gain a number of free +1-abilities, some Intelligent Item-bonuses or something similar. Further, you'll gain the ability to invest skill points and experience to it for increased returns (although it'll suck royally if it is destroyed – have your contingencies for Disjunction later on). Oh, and you can enhance your bow without actually having Item Creation feats. And you get a free Alertness when wielding the item (That is, all the time! And Spot just happens to be quite the important skill for you!). Probably my favorite of the three, although it really combines well with either.I especially like the Mercantile Background+Item Familiar-combo, and pull strings for the enchanting, providing the XP myself. That gives me the item for 37.5% of the original price with each item sale providing 25%-units more money. And it's available to any alignment (although Mercantile Background is Faerûn-specific – very easy to convert to any world though (basically, any member of a merchant family would do) – and Item Familiar is from a source you can never assume anything from).EquipmentMagic Weapon Special AbilitiesSplitting (+3 price) [CoR Pg. 42]Ok, so this is the best ability in the books. By far. It requires Precise Shot (just one extra reason to get it) and is a +3 ability, but by gods does it kick ass. Every attack you do hits. Twice. In effect, this doubles your damage output; normal +3 would be about ~+10 damage, this can be around +30 damage easily. Also, getting two attack rolls is incredibly useful for having higher hit percentage and goes perfectly with Woodland Archer [RoTW Pg. 154].There is a little ambiguity to whether this works with Precision Damage though; it does have two attack rolls which would suggest that it does, but effectively they act as a volley attack, hitting the same place and therefore wouldn't get Precision Damage added. You should check with your DM before getting this for your Precision Damage archer; it's probably still worth it if Precision Damage isn't doubled (since it increases the odds of hitting with it by tons), but that would make it much less good. Personally I wouldn't allow twice the Precision Damage for Splitting since the archer doesn't get to aim the pieces separately.Explosive (+2 HoB, ammo only; +3 CW) [HoB Pg. 130, CW Pg. 134]This is a useful in theory; it allows you to deal area of effect damage with your arrows. It can only be placed on Arrows, though. The downside is that this is very expensive on a ranged weapon and allows a DC 14 non-scaling Reflex-save to halve the damage. This does have a role, but not in normal adventure. The biggest use of this is against armies and craptons of mooks; as such this is better on arrows than a bow, although getting an Explosive Bow for an army fight could be a solid option. The damage is sad for +2 (1d6 = average of 3.5 damage, the average for +1 abilities and this one allows a save) though so this has a very specific application and is going to suck outside that.CW version is a +3 price enhancement dealing 2d4 damage with one point higher Save DC, making it even worse. It can be placed on Bows thoughKnockback (+3 price) [CW Pg. 135]This follows the pattern of CW-abilities; it's handy, but kinda expensive for what it does. This can be very useful against medium opponents, but earlier on it's too expensive and later on the guys who want to get close, the Fighters, tend to have enough Strength to win the check even at Medium. Still, getting 5 Bull rushes a turn means you'll win at least some so it isn't totally wasted. Of course it's better in areas where Bull rush naturally works, such as cliffs, areas with lethal terrain, trees, bridges and so on. It isn't going to be a sufficient deterrent to prevent melee warriors from getting to you alone though, so it's definitely something to only get in some Arrows. Still, there are many situations where you can do ugly stuff with this. +3 is a bit expensive though; this would be more interesting at +2.Phasing (+2 price, ammo only) [DR330 Pg. 67]Phasing ammunition passes through single solid obstacle at most 5' thick (how it interacts with magical barriers like Wall of Force and Prismatic Wall is not mentioned; ask your DM). I seriously don't need to tell you how useful it is to be able to shoot through walls, right? It also passes through shield if there's no cover, or armor if there's no cover or shield, but that's not really of interest here. You obviously buy stacks of these and use them when you need to shoot at someone past a wall. Of course, it's annoying that it's only ammunition but seriously, even if you shoot 50 arrows a turn, getting a bunch of these is worth it for when you're faced with any target behind an obstacle.Force (+2 price) [MIC Pg. 35]Archers usually have relatively low damage per arrow. That means Damage Reduction is a real bitch (save for very specific Sniper-builds). Enter Force. This +2 ability allows you to completely ignore Damage Reduction against everything except the Über Epic monster Force Dragon (CR Larger Than You'll Ever Face). Not only that, but it gives you perfect accuracy against Incorporeals and Ethereals. Oh, and since your arrow becomes Force Attack, Windwall – the perennial bane of Archers everywhere – doesn't work against it either. In other words, for a simple +2 ability, you get to ignore three of the biggest thorns Archers face. Thank you sir, may I have another? Even archers with natural abilities to overcome DR will want to consider this. The only reason not to get Force bow is if you already happen to have Energy Bow (or play in a campaign without MIC).Holy (+2 price) [SRD]Let's face it, most campaigns have evil guys as the prominent enemies. Holy is a +2 ability that works on all of them. And it gives you equivalent to two dice of elemental damage vs. each and every one. Oh, and it makes your weapon good for passing Damage Reduction (and archer can just have arrows/bolts of different materials around to switch as needed essentially allowing you bypass all Good and X-DRs; much easier than trying to have the right melee weapon). Not much to say, if you can afford it, it's one of the best abilities to get.Unholy (+2 price) [SRD]If the party is evil fighting good guys.Exit Wounds (+2 price) [CW Pg. 134]This is a useful ability. 1d6 damage for +2 isn't horrible, but the real use of this ability is to mimic the feat &quot;Penetrating Shot&quot; [PHBII Pg. 73] without actually taking it. Basically, when opponents line up properly, you could use one of these. Or 5. Two hits is always better than one and if you're a good shooter, you may just make it more than 2. I'd say it's worth keeping some arrows with this around if you can afford them and use them when the chance occurs.(Greater) Dispelling (+1/+2 price) [MIC Pg. 33]Very handy to have in arrows/bolts. If you fight against buffed up opponents or need to end some magic effects or overall need to dispel anything, these are the arrows for the job. The normal ability has a Per Day-restriction, but luckily that doesn't matter on arrows. Great to have in your bag of tools, and quite cheap to boot. Switch to Greater Dispelling when you feel the normal doesn't quite cover it anymore.Magebane (+1 price) [CA Pg. 143, MIC Pg. 38]One of the few Bane-properties worth having (on a bunch of arrows), this works against all things casting arcane spells or have Arcane Spell-Like abilities. In other words, it kicks ass. You could actually put this on your Bow if you face enough casters; +2 to hit/+2d6 damage for +1 ability is immense. Even if you don't, get those damn arrows. One-two stacks to use against Dragons, Liches, Beholders, Wizards and other problematic individuals. Very, very useful and quite possibly the most broad Bane-ability in existence.The MIC version unfortunately doesn't work on creatures with Spell-Like Abilities. The CA-version is much stronger. Still, even the MIC version is worth getting, just not in a weapon, but as arrows. It's still a very broad Bane-ability that works on, among others, Dragons and Liches, two very potent opponent types. Even the MIC version warrants Blue. CA version is more like Royal Blue.Bane (+1 price) [SRD]It may be worth it to keep a few Bane-arrows for more prominent types around. Unlike with normal weapons, due to the fact that a stack of 10 +2 arrows costs basically nothing (~1700gp) compared to midgame wealth, you can afford to keep a few Bane-weapons of appropriate types around. Aberrations are a good bet, as are Undead. Those types cover a wide variety of creatures and should come up often enough. Evil Outsiders, Magical Beasts and Fey are other solid options. Unfortunately Humanoids tend to be too specific, so unless your campaign is overwhelmingly based on one Humanoid-type, I'd steer clear of the Humanoid ones (and if there's such an overwhelming number of type X in campaign, maybe your bow should be Bane X instead of arrows).Corrosive (+1 price) [MIC Pg. 31]If you want elemental damage, Acid is probably least commonly resisted after Sonic (Screaming only deals 1d4, so I'd go with Corrosive).Seeking (+1 price) [SRD]This is a great ability negating all forms of concealment and few specific magical protections. No feat can replicate the reliability of Seeking and indeed, you even negate miss chance for attacking an invisible opponent as long as you get the square right. Absolute godsent at +1 cost.Precise (+1 price) [MIC Pg. 40]This replicates the Precise Shot-feat. Basically, if you believe your magical weapon won't get dispelled or sundered, you can use this to save a feat. Note though that it does not actually grant you the Precise Shot-feat so strict reading means it won't work with Splitting.Distance (+1 price) [SRD]This replicates the Far Shot-feat. Definitely something to keep in store (goes especially well with the Swiftwing Arrows [RoTW Pg. 164]); while long range combat isn't all that commonplace, as an archer you better be equipped to fight at that range should the situation require it. The primary selling point of archery over melee combat is the ability to affect opponents you cannot reach; being limited only to Extended Point Blank Range isn't exactly anything a melee warrior couldn't pull off just as well. These arrows are also cheap, so just keep some in storage.Collision (+2 price) [SRD]This adds +5 to the damage of a weapon. Essentially, you are trading a +2 to hit for +3 to damage, which is a favorable ratio.Specific Magic AmmunitionArrow/Bolt of Biting (Price 506 gp. Cost to create 256 gp) [MIC Pg. 46]+1 ammo that injects a target hit with an Injury Poison with DC 16 Fort-save for 1d6 Con. Pretty meh, since the Fort-save DC is so low. Actual poisons are generally more effective since they can be crafted for a very reasonable price if you have the skill, and there are ones with actually impressive Save DCs. These aren't completely worthless, but there are generally better ways to spend your money and since the save DC is pretty low, these aren't that useful as backups for particularly tough opponents either (since the tougher the opponent, the less likely these are to work).Fountainhead Arrow/Bolt (Price: 307 gp. Cost to create: 156 gp) [MIC Pg. 52]A normal ammo that can be shot at a flat surface to create a 10' radius burst Acid-spewing geyser. It acts on your turn and the acid deals 2d8 damage with a DC 14 Reflex for half. It actually isn't horrible since it's guaranteed damage against most creatures and it persists for 3 rounds; it can dig through many materials and the damage can even be useful against creatures if they for a reason or another can't move out of its area easily. And of course, if you happen to find a creature with flat surface to one direction or another, slamming a full flurry of these in its face would be exceedingly efficient; effective 3d8 extra damage (assuming saves succeed) plus the normal attack damage adds up real quick.Hellpiercer (Price: 4007 gp. Cost to create: 2007 gp) [BoED Pg. 115]This is a +3 shocking burst ammo that acts as Silver for overcoming DR and delivers a dose of Purified Couatl Venom ravage (DC 16 Injury Ravage for 2d4 and 4d4 Str damage). Price-wise, the arrows are actually cheaper than the ravage but the ravage is so low DC that it's probably not worth it. It works on evil creatures normally immune to poisons, but since the save DC is low, it's unlikely to. Ravages are probably not anyone's favorite thing from 3.5 in any case. Best we just forget about this.Mundane Weapon ImprovementsSerrenwood (+4000gp) [BoED Pg. 38]Serrenwood is a material. This is a great way of saving money especially if you cannot get a Force-bow. Serrenwood has a set price so it doesn't increase the magical cost of the bow. It's also one of the very few non-Magical ways of affecting incorporeals so even if you get your weapon Dispelled or something, you can still use a Serrenwood bow to drop ghosts (or Wizards with Ghostform; in fights against arcane casters, Serrenwood Bow and overall, all ways of doing magical things in mundane fashion are pure gold).I'd get a bunch of Serrenwood Arrows even if I had a Force-bow for the situations where one needs to hit incorporeal targets without Magic; as an archer you're one of the few possible characters who can pull that off.Dwarvencraft (+600 gp) [RoS Pg. 159]This is a weapon that's even more masterfully built than a Masterwork weapon. It doesn't enhance the weapon's capabilities, but gives it 2 extra Hardness, 10 extra HP and +2 to its saves. For 600gp, this makes your bow much harder to Sunder, which happens to be a very good thing as losing your primary weapon sucks (although you should keep extra bows in store just in case).Traditional ArcheryIf you want to train a longbowman, start with his grandfather.–King Edward IIOverview&amp;nbsp;Traditional Archery is the concept I'll be using for the traditional bows: Shortbow, Longbow and Greatbow. This chapter will deal with things applying to all archers using the traditional bows – their equipment, feats, potential downfalls and advantages. These will especially be compared to the other archery styles.Generally this is what's commonly understood to be Archery. If someone says 'archer', people are going to assume a traditional archer as opposed to a crossbow archer, a mounted archer or anything else. This is also the simplest type of Archery to optimize and as a consequence, the vast majority of Archer builds around fall under this category.Why choose traditional archery?The most important question when making an archer is naturally &quot;Why?&quot; Specifically, why archery instead of another kind of combat style and why make the kind of archer you're making. Traditional Archery has a number of things going on for it, but of course also suffers of some drawbacks.A quick look through the most prominent benefits and drawbacks of conventional archery:Advantages Can add Strength to damage (thanks to Composite Bows) No entry feats beyond the core Archery feats needed Longest range increments in the game (aside from Heavy Crossbow) No action needed to load the bow Great for volley attacks Best support from the official sources (most good Magical Bows are traditional and same goes for special ammo) Can easily use the Manyshot-line of feats for strafing attacks Can be made Elvencraft to be usable in melee as well as in range Disadvantages Use Dexterity for hitting and Strength for damage, inducing MAD Tends to rely on volleys, which means poor mobility Relatively low base damage Large weapons not fit for concealing FeatsEfficient Pull [DR350 Pg. 90] – Requires Point Blank ShotSo yea, this allows you to treat your strength +2 higher for the purposes of a bow being Mighty. Why does it suck? Well, normal bows don't autoadjust to new Strength. Even if you do manage to get a bow that does, you still only get grand +1 damage for your efforts and a friggin' feat!If the damage was +2, this could be remotely considerable, but as it stands, it gives you +2 Strength, not +2 Str-modifier for the purposes of Mighty bows, so you're better off picking useful feats instead. Oh yeah, and this is Dragon Magazine-material, so this usually isn't even available. Maybe that's for the best so new players avoid picking it?EquipmentBase WeaponsLongbow (75 gp) [SRD]A core NPC weapon, PCs will only use this on the first level if they can't afford a Composite Longbow. A Composite Longbow is better in every respect even if you have absolutely no Strength to add to the damage.Longbow, Composite (100 gp + 100 gp/Strength) [SRD]The core weapon in Traditional Archery, it's a Martial Weapon so the proficiencies are aplenty, it has a great range, decent damage and falls the in the sweet spot in most ways. You'll always use Composite Longbow over the normal Longbow once you are past level 1 and can afford it, just for the Strength to damage, but also for the extra range. The Composite Longbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.Longbow, Aquatic (400 gp) [Storm Pg. 107]This number is the only projectile weapon that can be used underwater without extreme penalties. The range increment underwater is only 10' (on water 60'), but that's quickly fixed by Ranged Weapon Mastery, Far Shot and Dragonbone (and Aquatic Shot [Storm Pg. 93]), giving you a nice 75' range increment underwater; that makes the weapon actually workable there, allowing you to shoot at targets with mere 1-2 increments before you're in melee. Extra benefit of the fact that underwater, cover is very rare so it's relatively easy to gain a real benefit of you range as long as you have means to spot the opponents far away. Unfortunately, there's no such thing as a Composite Aquatic Longbow so you're stuck without your Str modifier. Still, it's better than nothing.The Aquatic Longbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.Shortbow (30 gp) [SRD]The Shortbow is the worst of the traditional bows available in the game. It has the shortest range, the lowest damage and no redeeming qualities. The only reason to get one is that it costs effectively nothing, being the cheapest traditional bow available by far, costing whopping 45 gp less than the standard Longbow.Shortbow, Composite (75 gp + 75 gp/Strength) [SRD]The only reason to use a Shortbow over a Longbow is that your class only grants you one of the proficiencies. Classes with only Shortbow proficiency include Bards, Rogues and few other skill-based class.The Composite Shortbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Shortbow.Greatbow (150 gp) [CW Pg. 154]If you get Greatbow proficiency for free and can't afford a Composite Greatbow yet, might as well get one of these. It's strictly worse than the Composite Greatbow, but seeing that the Composite Greatbow is actually quite expensive, costing upwards to 1000 gp without magic, you may use this for a level or two.The Greatbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.Greatbow, Composite (200 gp + 200 gp/Strength) [CW Pg. 154]A few Fighter-variants get free Exotic Weapon Proficiency, so you might as well pick up Greatbow proficiency for free. Likewise, if you spend a feat on a bow proficiency, you might as well pick the Greatbow for the extra range and damage. Otherwise, the Greatbow usually isn't worth it except when looking to maximize range or when building a Fighter Archer with a limited number of books and running out of damage increasing feats to take; a Greatbow deals an average one point more than Longbow, and the difference increases with size increases (Large difference is 2, Huge is 3, I recall.)The Composite Greatbow shares a Weapon Focus-tree with the Longbow.Double Bow, Elven (1000 gp) [AE Pg. 7]This is a strange one. You can spend a Move Action to load up a second arrow and then your next attack is a Volley Attack at -2. You can, if you somehow get extra Move Actions, combine this with a full attack for effectively an extra arrow and it doesn't even punish your entire volley, only the next attack. Of course, the kicker is that there's no Composite version of this listed which means no Strength-bonus to damage. If you get DM to allow Composite versions of these, this might very well be worth the feat. Without Strength-modifier, the extra shot being a Volley Attack and thus applying precision damage only once, it is by and large impractical to use one of these even with something like Belt of Battle [MiC Pg. 73] or Quicksilver Motion [ToB Pg. 65] to gain those Move Actions. Anyone with Longbow proficiency can use one of these as a Longbow, but you need Exotic Weapon Proficiency to use the special features.Footbow (150 gp + 100 gp/Strength) [RoTW Pg. 164]Now, this one is a doozy. It's an Exotic Composite Longbow that is designed for use while flying; it takes a -4 penalty when used in ground and can only be used prone. It has the same stats as a Composite Longbow, and is a martial weapon for Raptorans. Why would anyone else use it though? One thing: 1½ Str to damage. That is, a Footbow is kept under feet when flying and you can either fire it with one hand as per normal, having your other free for god knows what, or you can fire it Two-Handed and add 1½ Str to damage. This one is very much worth the effort, if a bit weird weapon to use.If I were a flying archer without much regard for stylistic factors, I'd definitely get me one of these, even at the expense of a feat. This also makes Raptoran Archers a very solid prospect.Bow, Yuan-Ti Serpent (150 gp) [SoX Pg. 137]An exotic weapon that's basically a Longbow and a Short Sword in one. The basic idea is good; you always threaten the area around you and can do ranged attacks without wasting actions switching between the modes. The problem, of course, is that the Elvencraft property can be added to any bow and while with it you are stuck with 20/x2 crits in melee, you also saved a feat on Exotic Weapon Proficiency. Worst of all, there are no Composite Yuan-Ti Serpent Bows to add your Strength to damage; without those it's practically never worth it using one. Elvencraft is just plain better.Mundane AmmunitionRazorfeather Ammunition (150 gp) [MMV Pg. 169]These aren't actually listed being sold anywhere, but by the Craft-rules in PHB, raw materials cost a third of the final result, and Razorfeathers cost 50 gp a piece. The ammunition is considered to be Masterwork, but the book isn't clear as to whether you have to build the Masterwork component separately or if you just work the Feathers and they're automatically considered Masterwork. May be that the actual cost is 156 gp a piece; that's counting the Masterwork cost for each.Anyways, these arrows are awesome. Just completely incredible. First of all, they're mundane weapons that are considered Keen. That's a +1 property almost for free. Second, they're considered Masterwork and Adamantine. That means they're just about the best mundane arrows you can have. It takes a DC 30 Craft (weaponsmithing) check to make 50 of them. You should ask your DM if these are sold in your campaign, and if they aren't, it may be an interesting prospect to go on a Steelwing hunt on Acheron or the Material Plane, and train a bit in the arts of Weaponsmithing (or get help from your friendly neighborhood Wizard with his immense Int-mod).Arrow, Alchemist's (1500 gp for 20x) [AE Pg. 5, DR349 Pg. 28]These are basically normal arrows with x2 crit range, except they deal 1d4 fire damage the turn after unless the victim spends a full-round action and makes a DC 15 Reflex-save to extinguish the flames. Very convenient, though somewhat pricy. Extra damage is never a bad thing.The Dragon version is almost worthless, having two categories lower base damage than normal and only 3/4th range increment.Arrow, Alchemist's Frost (1500 gp for 20x) [DR349 Pg. 28]These arrow have two categories lower base damage (1d4 for Longbow) and 3/4th range increment to go with x2 critical rating. On hit, they deal 1d4 extra cold damage immediately, and the arrow shatters. Expensive, though it can be useful against creatures particularly vulnerable to cold.Arrow, Blunt (1 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]These arrows deal Bludgeoning and subdual damage. In other words, these are the perfect tools for taking prisoners, especially when opponent is escaping. As a downside though, many creatures with DR/Bludgeoning also have immunity to subdual damage, so it isn't useful for solving that; you'll still need to default to magical abilities against them. It's worth noting that these aren't metallic to any degree, making them completely able to bypass the pain-of-a-spell Ironguard, which archers otherwise have trouble with. These are cheap, so I'd always keep at least one stack of these with me. Do note that they have a reduced critical multiplier though. These also have halved range increment of the core bow, with any adjustments for Composite Bow added on top of the half (so fired from Longbow, the increment is half of 100' = 50', but from Composite Longbow half of 100' + 10' = 60').Arrow, Dragonsbreath (50 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]These arrows have reduced core damage, but deal 1 point of Fire-damage on impact and require a DC 15 Reflex-save or light the opponent ablaze. Certainly handy against Ice monsters, especially Giants and the like. Also good for lighting oil or the like ablaze. These are very useful when used properly, but since they deal reduced damage and have no benefits vs. creatures with fire immunity, I'd still use normal arrows as my normal weapon with these as a special treat for vulnerable opponents.Also note that this is completely nonmagical, and that enough arrows can make anyone roll that 1 for Reflex. Fire is only 1d6 per turn with a new Reflex-save each turn (who the hell thought of that – have people never seen human catch fire and how impossible it is to put out alone?), so it's not that major later on. On earlier levels and against poor Ref-save opponents, it can be handy though.Arrow, Flight (160 gp for 20x) [AE Pg. 5, DR349 Pg. 29]These are normal arrows except with x2 criticals, and they add 25' to the attacks' range increment. Somewhat similar to Swiftwing Arrows in function, but these actually increase your range increments and your maximum range while Swiftwings make it easier to land shots at a longer range, and lose out on base damage instead of critical multiplier. Probably a tool you'll want in your repertoire, though these are fairly expensive like many of these special arrows.Arrow, Hardwood (10 gp for 20x) [DR330 Pg. 92]These break 25% of the time instead of 50% of the time when missing the target. Yeah, I don't care either. I suppose if you have magical arrows, making them of Hardwood increases the chance of your missed arrows being retrievable. I guess it might save you small amounts of money.Arrow, Pungent (5 gp for 20x) [DR330 Pg. 92]These arrows deal no damage, but they &quot;paint&quot; the target with a scent helping tracking. There's a +1 on Survival-checks to track hit target, or +4 if the tracker has Scent.Arrow, Serpentstongue (3 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]These arrows are used for sundering. Amusingly enough, they deal both, Piercing and Slashing damage. They also deal full damage to objects with hardness less than 5. Again, something to keep around. They also don't have any drawbacks compared to normal arrows besides also dealing Slashing damage so you could actually consider replacing your normal arrows with these.Arrow, Signal (10 gp for 20x) These arrows deal normal weapon damage at x2 multiplier. They also have -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls making them inconvenient for that purpose. What they are good for though is signalling; they let out a sound resembling the cry of some bird (DC 20 Survival-check allows a listener to determine if the sound came from a bird or another source; DR349 calls for DC 20 Knowledge (Nature) check instead). Elves use these to coordinate their military efforts; your party can do the same. Very simple method of long range communication, and cheap at that.Arrow, Smoking (600 gp for 20x) [DR349 Pg. 29]These arrows need to be lit to fire them. They leave a trail of thick black smoke behind them and when they land, they act like a Smokestick, leaving a 10' cube of smoke in the target square. Good for creating smoke screen especially if you have a Seeking bow. Kind of expensive and the smoke lasts for only a short time, though.Arrow, Star (10 gp for 20x)These arrows are normal, except they also provide illumination. A Star Arrow provides bright illumination 5' away and shadowy illumination 15' away. Very convenient for hunting in the dark.Arrow, Swiftwing (20 gp for 20x) [RoTW Pg. 165]These are excellent for firing far away; they only suffer half the normal increment penalties. Ask your DM how this interacts with Cragtop Archer's ability doing the same. Anyways, they have one category reduced damage, but they actually make those long shots possible without tons of feats, so I'd definitely have a bunch of these in my Quiver. Especially good for sniping things like Dragons from far away a turn or two before they reach you (once that's taken flight, that is). If you have ~200ft increment, you'd be able to shoot to 1000ft with mere -5 to the roll.Arrow, Thundering (40 gp for 20x) [AE Pg. 5]These arrows deal no damage instead exploding as a Thunderstone on impact. Basically, they force a DC 15 Fortitude save against being deafened for an hour. These have some niche uses but as they don't deal damage, I don't expect one to use them all that often. Pack a couple with you and when the situation comes up, profit.Arrow, Zigzag (3 gp for 20x) [DR330 Pg. 92]These arrows take -4 on attacks but deal double damage to objects with Hardness 0. The damage is unfortunately restricted to objects so no hope of double damaging creatures but they're rather convenient in some specific scenarios, like for severing ropes. Given how cheap they are, might as well. These deal Slashing or Piercing damage.Magic WeaponsEnergy Bow (22600 gp) [WoTC Site]This is one of the best bows in existence. It can shoot Force Arrows for 2d6 damage, it adjusts to user's strength and most importantly, it can be used for Power Shots. Power Shot is an ability that simply doesn't exist in official 3.5 beyond this (3.0 class Peerless Archer has it, and it hasn't been updated so it's legal in 3.5 with all sources though). Power Shot is also one of the easiest ways to overcome the difficulty of dealing damage with bows.Basically, this is a cheap specific bow with two unique abilities. If you can get this and further enchant it (with Splitting), it's easily the best bow in the game.Bow of the Wintermoon (3400gp) [MIC Pg. 48]Don't be mislead by the fact that this is a Relic of Corellon Larethian. Don't worry about the alignment restriction either. What this item is, is a magical base bow with adjusting strength. Regardless of your alignment and the relic status, it's a bow that automatically adjusts to the wielder's strength, and at a very reasonable price. You can add any actual enhancements you want on this hull and you don't need to give a rat's ass about the Relic-powers. For what it's worth, they're pretty awful; you get a +1 enhancement out of being Chaotic Good, Neutral Good or Chaotic Neutral and Frost + Drowbane out of the True Believer or a 5th level spellslot. Given the specificity of both enhancements, it's not really worth your while outside some really heavily Drow-focused campaigns.Bowstaff (4600gp) [MIC Pg. 48]Basically an Elvencraft Bow that requires a swift action to activate as a magic item. Yeah, no.Bow of Songs (12330gp) [MIC Pg. 48]If you have Bardic Music, the ability to add your Cha to hit&amp;nbsp;and damage for one Bardic Music use is actually kinda good. The only issue with this bow is, it's a swift action to activate and only applies on one attack meaning it's not very useful on full attacks Bards would normally prefer due to Inspire Courage applying to all their attacks. It can be worthwhile on low levels and in some niché cases like some Sniper-build with high Cha, guaranteed crit and high crit modifier on a single attack, but in general, it's at most an extra option for some special circumstances.Oathbow (25600 gp) [SRD]I'm just listing this here to tell you not to get it even if you only have access to DMG items. The ability that makes it almost worthwhile is Once per day against one opponent and it sucks against everything else at that point. It's almost decent against BBEG, except +1 Holy bow with Greater Magic Weapon cast on it tends to be just as good against all opponents without any activations, and much easier on the wallet to boot. The only thing good about this bow is that it speaks phrases of Elven.Magical AmmunitionBurrowing Arrow (167 gp) [CW Pg. 135]This is basically an anti-healing arrow; if target is healed, this deals 1d8 damage and it stops natural healing. This isn't very interesting, overall. The +1d8 damage just isn't that much and natural healing rarely makes a difference in fights. I suppose it might prevent Polymorph healing since that's only a function of the natural healing rate of the polymorphed creature, but ehh... Again, these cost practically nothing in small quantities so I guess you might want to pick one up and in case you come up with a use for it, shoot it.Raptor Arrows (MIC 6006 gp, CD 14500 gp) [MIC Pg. 56, CD Pg. 93]This is a Relic of Ehlonna. CD version is almost strictly worse with the difference that it deals 1d8 damage when it lodges itself out of the target. Other than that, CD version only is Bane vs. your Favored Enemies, requires 6th level spell slot and costs over twice as much as the MIC version. MIC is also newer so it takes precedence. Basically, these are Returning Arrows that can't break on shooting and give you +2 to hit and +2+2d6 damage over and beyond any abilities on your Bow against every target.Slaying Arrow (2282 gp (Greater: 4075 gp)) [SRD]Slaying Arrows are the usual fare far as save-offering magic items go. The save DC is relatively low for the price (20 for normal, 23 for Greater) and thus they're largely impractical. The exception here is, however, that it can affect creatures normally immune to Fortitude-saves, notably Constructs and Undead. Those creatures by and large have horrible Fort-saves so acquiring a Slaying Arrow or two (or Greater varieties) keyed off to Constructs and Undead can be very much worth your while to keep one-two around of when you face an Undead or a Construct particularly problematic to kill in the classic fashion.Sleep Arrow (132 gp) [SRD]Par de course arrow that does pretty much what you'd expect: Tries to put people to sleep. Given how many different ways there are to resist this, and the fact that the Will save DC is 11, I wouldn't expect these to work. Not the kind of item I'd be thrilled to buy though they're relatively cheap so it's not a huge deal either way. Low cost, low impact. Oh, and they deal non-lethal damage, though there are cheaper ways of accomplishing that (Blunt Arrows, for one).Mundane Weapon ImprovementsDragonbone (+100 gp) [Drac Pg. 117]Dragonbone Bow is the tool for Extreme Range-archers. With mere 100gp extra cost, the bow gets 20ft longer Range Increments. Generally, if you don't get a Serrenwood Bow, you might as well get a Dragonbone Bow. It's very cheap and has a tangible benefit (although the use of extra reach depends on the campaign).Elvencraft (+300 gp) [RoTW Pg. 166]This quality is one of the best things you could ever add to a bow and only costs 300gp. Basically, it makes your Bow double as either a Club (Shortbow) or Quarterstaff (Longbow). Greatbow isn't touched upon in RoTW, but it would probably also be either a Quarterstaff or a Longstaff. This is a great way to fight both, in range and in melee without Quick Draw and to avoid having to cause AoOs by firing bow when threatened. This is also one of the best ways to build a Sublime Way Archer as Elvencraft Bow allows using the martial strikes in melee when need be while still giving you the freedom to fire at will.Magic ItemsBracers of Archery, Lesser (5000 gp) [SRD]These Bracers give you proficiency with whatever Bow you're wielding. Can be handy for Cleric-types, Rogues et al. to wield Shortbows, Longbows and Greatbows without trouble. If you're already proficient with the bow in question, you get +1 Competence on attack rolls. If you don't have a Cleric or a Bard giving you those Competence-bonuses, it may be worth 5000 gp on midlevels. Mostly these are useful for the proficiency-part though.Bracers of Archery, Greater (25000 gp) [SRD]These Bracers likewise give you proficiency with whatever Bow you're wielding. However, the reason they're so much more expensive than Lesser versions is because they grant you +2 Competence to attacks and +1 Competence to damage. If you don't have a buffer giving you these types of bonuses, the Bracers are great since those bonuses stack with everything. Otherwise they're worthless.&amp;nbsp;Crossbow ArcheryThe classics say that the crossbow is fury due to the noise that it makes, and by using the volley fire method, there is no end to the sound and fury, which renders the enemy is unable to approach.&quot;–Li Quan, Tang Dynasty military official, 759 CEOverviewLongtime redheaded bastard child of straight bows, Crossbows have two places in the game. First, they're simple ranged weapons for non-martial classes on the first levels when they'd rather stay out of combat and do something when they don't want to expend spells. That's where Crossbows come in handy, as everyone has proficiency, they're cheap and do mean damage on level 1 without any stat dependency. Of course, since reloading them takes a while, they are usually only used few times and before iteratives kick in.At that point, dedicated Crossbow Archers begin to find ways to take advantage of their iteratives, while others move to weapons that don't require quite the commitment. Crossbows are much like straight bows, except they cost you many more feats to use effectively, but offer the option of dual wielding with sufficient magical assistance and feat expenditure. Crossbow Sniper-feat [PHBII, Pg. 77] also gives them solid Single Attribute Dependency with Dex to both, to hit and damage (unfortunately only half to damage though). This allows a Crossbow Archer to operate on a much worse point buy than a traditional Archer. One final advantage Crossbows enjoy is that they can be fired prone, which is very advantageous in ranged combat, although rarely useful in normal adventures.Why choose crossbow archery?So why would I make a Crossbow Archer?Advantages&amp;nbsp;Crossbows are cheap (thus good for lowlevel play and mooks)&amp;nbsp;Can add Dex to damage (thanks to Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77])Can be dual wielded (but not reloaded that way without assistance)Heavier Crossbows have great base damageNormal Crossbows are simple weaponsCan be fired proneHand Crossbow is easily concealedCan use one-handed, holding a shield, a melee weapon or something else in the other hand (at penalties though)Aquatic Crossbows are probably the best ranged weapons underwaterDisadvantagesFeat intensive (I can't emphasize this enough - normal archery feats + crossbow feats + possible Exotic Weapon Proficiencies, TWF, etc. = pain)Heavier Crossbows are very slow to loadCannot be used for iteratives without trickeryDo not naturally add any stat to damageBasically require at least one feat to be used with iterative attacksEven less mobile than straight bows (due to move actions being spent on reloading earlier on)FeatsCrossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77] - Requires Crossbow Proficiency, Weapon Focus (crossbow), +1 BABYou get ½ Dex to damage with the Crossbow you have Weapon Focus in. You also gain the ability to Skirmish and Sneak Attack at the range of 60'. Every serious Crossbow Archer should have this, period. This feat singlehandedly makes Crossbows worth using. Without this feat, I probably wouldn't bother with this section at all.Rapid Reload [SRD] - Requires Crossbow ProficiencyThis allows you to actually shoot iteratives with Light and Hand Crossbows. This removes the need for Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Repeating Crossbow as it becomes a free action to load their simple counterparts.Quick Draw [SRD] - Requires +1 BABQuick Draw isn't normally very useful for a Crossbow Archer, but there's one specific benefit; like a Thrower, you can get multiple iteratives with Crossbows by dropping the one you fired and drawing a new one. This allows you to TWF with Crossbows taking full iteratives without actually using any magic or other kinds of cheats. This is a fair-and-honest way of being able to machine gun Crossbows. It's kind of expensive to enhance that many Crossbows though so it gets impractical later on.Also note that Quick Draw is a prerequisite for the Skill Tricks Hidden Blade (used on your own turn) [CS Pg. 87] and Sudden Draw (used AoO, takes a bit of work to get ranged AoOs) [CS Pg. 89], which allow you to attack opponent with a concealed weapon treating him as flat-footed, so that's an additional use of the feat for Sleight of Hand-using Crossbow Archers.Hand Crossbow Focus [DoTU Pg. 50] - Requires Hand Crossbow Proficiency, +1 BABThis feat is Rapid Reload and Weapon Focus: Hand Crossbow in one feat. If you're going for Hand Crossbow focus, this is strictly better than Rapid Reload. Also, the Weapon Focus can lead into Ranged Weapon Mastery [PHBII Pg. 82] for massive damage quite easily.Rapid Shot [SRD] - Requires Dex 13, Point Blank ShotIf you can get by the Reload-difficulties Crossbows suffer of, Rapid Shot is just as good for Crossbow Archers as it is for Traditional Archers. Unfortunately, TWFing Crossbow Archers may suffer of piling penalties with Rapid Shot and need to be cautious as to how many extra attacks to take for those penalties.EquipmentBase WeaponsLight Crossbow (35 gp) [SRD]Like Composite Longbow with bows, this hits the sweet spot of Crossbows. You can get Free Action reload, you have decent base damage, only -2 penalty for wielding these one-handed, simple weapon proficiency-wise, the core Crossbow. This is what you should default to in normal sitiuations. Also, since the normal loading is only a Move Action, it's often usable on the first levels since you can effectively spend a Full-Round Action to attack once with this.You can also Two-Weapon Fight with these in a multitude of ways. You can use Gloves of Storing in both hands (or one hand if DM allows switching hands as a free action, which should be possible with Quick Draw) to Free Action-vanish one bow to load the other (likewise a free action), then free action call the vanished weapon, shoot the other, make the one which shot vanish, load the other, etc. allowing you to take full iteratives provided that your DM doesn't put a stop to your Free Action-madness. Ghostly Reload-spell [RoTD Pg. 113] gets you 10 shots of free reloads with both hands too. There's also the weapon ability Quick Loading [MiC Pg. 41], which gives the weapon its own extradimensional space that holds 100 bolts and loads them as a free action for Light Crossbows and Hand Crossbows, likewise allowing you to dual wield Light Crossbows. Bottomline, you can find a way to get two of these go off with iteratives. If nothing else, have a ton of them with Quick Draw and drop the shot ones, drawing a new one for each separate attack.Crossbow, Aquatic (250 gp) [Storm Pg. 107]If you have even the slightest hint of the possibility of going underwater, pick one of these along. It doesn't hurt to have one at all, and this is quite possibly the best underwater weapon in the game. The range increment is 40' (it uses the same 40' increment on land too; quite bad there, but awesome in water). By comparison, Aquatic Longbow shoots at a 10' range underwater, and that's long. Also, since Crossbows don't require Composite construction for any extra damage, you get your ½ Dex to damage as per normal as long as you've got Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77].Really, if I was playing in a mostly underwater campaign with a terran race, I'd probably play a Warforged Crossbow Sniper and pick up one of these babies. With Ranged Weapon Mastery and Far Shot, you'll be able to crank the Increment up to 80', and with Gnome Crossbow Sight, you can shoot at 240' without penalties (although DM fiat may make Gnome Crossbow Sight not work underwater). Also, you suffer no damage loss underwater; you're just as effective underneath as you're on the surface.Heavy Crossbow (50 gp) [SRD]Heavy Crossbow obviously hits harder than Light Crossbow. Early on though, it's very hard to use beyond the initial shot due to the fact that it takes a full-round action to load. The average damage drops way under Light Crossbow after turn 1 (Light Crossbow has dealt 9 points while Heavy Crossbow mere 5.5). You do have a Move Action to spare every turn you shoot one of these though. Shooting a Heavy Crossbow in one hand is a -4 penalty.The real reason to use these is the Ghostly Reload-spell, which gives you Free Action-reloading on Heavy Crossbow allowing you to do iteratives with the extra damage. You could also dual wield these, but without very heavy investure of feats and class levels, you'd be taking -6 or worse penalty on all attacks. At this point you'd be better off using Great Crossbow, since it's apparent that Feats Are No Object, and at medium Great Crossbow does whopping 3.5 points more damage than Heavy Crossbow for Exotic Weapon Proficiency-feat.Hand Crossbow (100 gp) [SRD]These are a whole different ballpark. They serve the same as Light Crossbow in the respect of being able to machine gun either in one hand, or with trickery in two hands. However, what really sets these apart is that a Hand Crossbow is very easy to conceal with Sleight of Hand, giving you tricks you can pull off with the Hidden Blade [CS Pg. 87] and Sudden Draw [CS Pg. 89] skill tricks, as well as to simply take to places where you aren't allowed weapons.It doesn't hurt that even though these are Exotic Weapons, Rogues come with free proficiency in them. There's also the Hand Crossbow-specific feat &quot;Hand Crossbow Focus&quot; [DoTU Pg. 50], which is Rapid Reload and Weapon Focus (Hand Crossbow) in one feat. On their own, these are pretty much Light Crossbows with shorter range and worse damage (no penalties for shooting them in one hand though), but thanks to the support they get from outside sources, Hand Crossbows are respectable weapons on their own right.Great Crossbow (150 gp) [RoS Pg. 155]This is an exotic Heavy Crossbow. However, the stats are totally out of whack; the average damage is two categories higher (a total of 3.5 point difference), it has a better threat range, increments are the same. So basically, it's got completely insane damage output compared to Heavy Crossbow and is otherwise the same. If I was making a build focusing on Heavy Crossbows, I'd make it a point to find room for Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Great Crossbow - that is one of those very rare opportunities where a single feat adds over 4 points of damage to every attack you make.Same stuff applies to Great Crossbow as to Heavy Crossbow; generally it's profitable with Ghostly Reload enabling iteratives, although some true Sniper-build could also be made with this damage...the weapon is really a portable Ballista.Light Crossbow, Repeating (250 gp) [SRD]This weapon is a true turkey. For Exotic Weapon Proficiency, you get Light Crossbow that you can do iteratives with...with clips of 5 bolts! Then you need to use a full-round action to load the damn thing! At the point where you need the iteratives, you'll be spending one turn shooting, other loading. This particular exotic weapon manages to be strictly worse than a simple weapon + a feat. Simple Rapid Reload + Light Crossbow gets you iteratives without limit!Last hope dies when you realize that this pile of crap cannot even be loaded without the other hand. So if you dualwield these, they'll be exactly as efficient as simple weapons. Just...don't touch these. Ever. It's quite possibly the worst Exotic Weapon in print. Oh yeah, and it costs like 7 times the price of the simple counterpart and even the bolts manage to be more expensive. It does share proficiency with the usable Repeating Heavy Crossbow though, so it's kind of a free, useless gift.Heavy Crossbow, Repeating (400 gp) [SRD]Unlike its Light counterpart, Repeating Heavy Crossbow actually doesn't suck at everything. This is really the only way outside magic to get iteratives with a Heavy Crossbow. Don't bother loading, just use Quick Draw to draw a second Heavy Crossbow once the first one is empty. You only need one per turn of combat even on later levels, so this should be more affordable than the mass Hand Crossbow/Light Crossbow enhancement.You could also dual wield these with the Gloves of Storing-trick, albeit at immense -6 penalties even with Oversized Two-Weapon Fighting [CAdv Pg. 111]. Make no mistake, this one probably isn't worth your time nor the Exotic Weapon Proficiency you spent on it, but it at least has a reason to exist unlike the Light counterpart.Light Double Crossbow (70 gp) [RoTD Web Enhancement]These Exotic Weapons are interesting cases with tons of controversial rules about them (mostly just poorly written). You get two attacks at your full attack bonus as a full-round attack if you have the Double Crossbow-proficiency. You can use the two bolts as iteratives if you lack proficiency in Double Crossbow. This raises the question if free action-loading Double Crossbows are effectively Two-Weapon Fighting without the feat (able to take iteratives) and if you can dual wield Double Crossbows, shooting both separately with iteratives.Basically, these require DM fiat to make them interesting; by RAW they can only use the extra bow on the special attack action. If you could combine it with full attack as per Rapid Shot (something the article references, raising a question about the intent here), these might be worth considering.It's worth noting that all Double Crossbows have -2 worse penalties for using in one hand compared to normal Crossbows, so Light Double Crossbow's penalty for TWFing is -4.Heavy Double Crossbow (100 gp) [RoTD Web Enhancement]Do note that Double Crossbow-proficiency is just one feat; these all share proficiency, just like the Repeating Crossbows. Early on in the game, you could use Heavy Double Crossbow to take double shots at opponent for maximum damage and once you start getting iteratives, switch to Light Double Crossbow to maximize the number of attacks.These can't be reloaded quickly (save possibly with Ghostly Reload) and have immense penalties for using in one hand, so you probably won't be dual wielding them no matter what (-8 with multiple feats).Hand Double Crossbow (200 gp) [RoTD Web Enhancement]These probably lend themselves best to the machine gun-idea presented above. Wielding one of these in one hand only costs you -2 to hit and having free reload from Quick Loading or whatever would mean that you would get to take the extra attack with each plus full iteratives, along with Rapid Shots and what have you at reasonable penalties. This seems like a solid plan with Crossbow Sniper [PHBII Pg. 77] to maximize the damage output.Icechucker (150 gp) [Frost Pg. 77]This is really on the edge of not counting as a Crossbow. Anyways, it throws large shards of Ice as the name suggests, or alternatively Javelins when Ice isn't available. Unfortunately, bigger isn't always better it seems and the damage doesn't really increase at all and the range is poor. This is only good in very specific circumstances where Bolts are unavailable. Other than that, it's far worse than Great Crossbow and a total waste of Exotic Weapon Proficiency. I'm just mentioning it for completeness's sake.Magic WeaponsArmbow, Warforged (20000 gp) [ECS Pg. 268]This is a Warforged component and thus not available to anyone else. Anyways, we're talking about a +2 Repeating Light Crossbow here. However, unlike standard Repeating Crossbows, this one automatically reloads itself. Now, it can only make 20 bolts a day by itself after which you need to make extras at the rate of 1 HP/Bolt, but few heal-effects allow you to ignore such nonsense. You can also create Aligned Bolts with 3 HP a piece, a bargain to ignore annoying Damage Reductions - just make sure you have the means to restore your HP. The important part is that since the reloading happens automatically, I'd wager you can do flurries at will with these, even Two-Handed.It isn't spelled out in the book (in fact, the only thing it states about the weapon is that &quot;shooting and loading it is a standard action&quot;, but seeing that we're talking about a Repeating Light Crossbow, it would seem logical to assume it can be used to fire iteratives at will. Also, no penalty is listed for using it one-handed, so technically you should be able to get two of these and use them without penalties other than the normal TWF-penalties. The only turnoff here is the fact that you do need Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Repeating Crossbow for these, but since the Heavy version isn't so bad for the early levels, it may not be that bad. The worse part is that you're a Warforged and thus don't get the Human Bonus Feat level 1, so you'll be really featstarved as you need:-Archery feats-Crossbow feats-Two-Weapon Fighting feats-Exotic Weapon ProficiencyStill, pulling it off just may be worth it!Magic Weapon Special AbilitiesQuick Loading (+1 price) [MiC Pg. 41]This ability is very worthy for crossbow archers of certain archetypes. It's by far the simpliest way of enabling iterative attacks when dual wielding Crossbows. 100 bolts should be enough even for the longest of encounters after which you can spend a minute or two refilling the magazines. Furthermore, the ability allows you to choose which Bolt is loaded each time so you actually get free golfbag effect so typical for straight bows with this.If it's available, I'd grab a pair of Light Crossbows with this. Unfortunately, loading Heavy Crossbow even with Quick-Loading is still a Move Action thus not helping there. Potentially, Quick-Loading Heavy Crossbow with Ghostly Reload cast on it could be used 10 times like normal Light Crossbows with the spell. This isn't spelled out anywhere though and would be purely a houserule, but an extremely logical one.Mundane Weapon ImprovementsCrossbow Sight, Gnome (+150 gp) [AE Pg. 36]This is again a 3.0 ability, but unfortunately they simply haven't printed much of use for Crossbows in 3.5; it's a fair game to go 3.0 in search of goodies. Anyways, this is effectively a Sniper Scope. With this, you can truly act as a Crossbow Sniper. Basically, this allows you to ignore up to two range increment. Yes, that's right, with a Crossbow Sight, you can use a standard Heavy Crossbow at the range of 360' without any penalties whatsoever! And with Far Shot et al. this gets much better. Very handy, especially in wilderness and areas with long vision, it costs you practically nothing and gives you a huge, if situational benefit so come midlevels, I'd get one immediately (it also allows using Hand Crossbow on medium ranges without penalties).&amp;nbsp;Mounted ArcheryNot even a mighty warrior can break a frail arrow when it is multiplied and supported by its fellows.-Genghis Khan OverviewMounted combat isn't really the most common topic in D&amp;amp;D forums, but the game does support the combat style quite well. In fact, mounted combatants are at an immense advantage compared to normal characters since you get double moves and full-round actions at the same time. Historically, Mounted Archery was the advantage that allowed Genghis Khan to conquer the known world so there has to be something to this combat style in the game too, right?Mounted Archers are really efficient in the open simply due to the fact that they can keep firing while their Mount keeps them out of combat, and even more so with the more exotic mount options available, such as flying and teleporting monsters, and monsters that are fearsome combatants on their own rights all the way up to the almighty Dragons. The important part is getting a mount that isn't going to die midfight, and preferably one that can contribute itself. Early on, you can just shop for a mount, but later on you'll probably want a Mount as a class feature lest it gets toasted in the first AoE attack you face. Also, a Mounted Archer really wants to be small to be able to fit into most dungeons with the Mount; it sucks to have to give up the advantages a Mount offers just because you're in for a dungeon crawl. Even though mobility is limited in a dungeon, a Riding Dog moving each down with you shooting goes a long way to keeping you out of trouble. Just keep as much space available as possible.Why choose mounted archery?What does fighting mounted actually do for an archer compared to his normal capabilities?Advantages&amp;nbsp;Mobility (the most important reason to pick a mount by far - you can full attack while moving)Extra offense (the mount is often an able combatant on its own right)Extra protection (Ride-checks can be used to dodge attacks)Support character (some mounts, such as Unicorns, have very useful boost skills that can be used for you)Extra actions (mount can generally take actions separately of you on your initiative, effectively giving you extra actions)Use for class features such as Animal Companion and FamiliarDisadvantagesLongbow cannot be used while mounted (curiously enough, Composite Longbows, on the other hand, can)Ties a skill and a half (Ride and potentially Handle Animal)Ties some more feats, making the otherwise more Mount-friendly Crossbow archery more difficult to pull off effectively (Mounted Combat and Mounted Archery are nearly musts)You need to acquire a Mount somehow, be it purchasing a Heavy Warhorse (400 gp) or having Mount- or Animal Companion-class featuresMountsMounted combat is all fine and good, but you kind of need to get the Mount-part right first. There are various means to acquire a mount in D&amp;amp;D, but it mostly comes down to five options:-Buy one, possibly already trained-Tame/grow one yourself, by buying/finding eggs or simply using Handle Animal/Wild Empathy to get one to come along-Use classes with class features that can be used for Mounts (mostly Animal Companion and Mount)-Get the Leadership-feat and acquire a cohort that works as a Mount-Ride an ally such as party's wildshaped Druid.Feats and cohorts I'll cover later and riding an ally doesn't need to be covered, so this section will be about purchasable and tamable mounts.Riding Dog (150 gp) [SRD]Good mount for small characters. War trained riding dogs can make trip attacks like wolves do.War Pony (100 gp) [SRD]There's not much of a&amp;nbsp; point in choosing this over a Riding Dog.Donkey or Mule (8 gp) [SRD]Stolid in the face of danger, donkeys and mules can be used as mounts in combat. They have a relatively slow movement speed of 30 feet, though.War Horse, Light (150 gp) [SRD]Now we're talking! The light war horse has double the speed of donkeys and mules, for only 19 times more! This will enable you to strafe and kit enemies outdoors.&amp;nbsp;War Horse, Heavy (400 gp) [SRD]The heavy war horse trades 10 feet of speed for a few more hitpoints, and costs over twice as much as the light war horse. It's better for mounted combat than mounted archery.Centaur [SRD]DO NOT RIDE THE CENTAUR!Giant Owl&amp;nbsp; (2500 gp for egg,&amp;nbsp; 4000 for chick, 1000 gp to train) [SRD]The Giant Owl is chiefly notable for being stealthy and having great low light vision.Giant Eagle (2500 gp for egg,&amp;nbsp; 4000 for chick, 1000 gp to train) [SRD]You can ride a giant eagle and feel epic while doing so. But it's more expensive and slower than a pegasus, the real flying mount of epics.Pegasus (2000 gp for egg, 3000 gp for foal, 1000 gp to train) [SRD]If it was good enough for Perseus, it's good enough for you! The mighty pegasus allows Good aligned riders access to flight (with a speed of 120 feet at average maneuverability) and can reliably detect good and evil, which can be handy.It's odd that the Monster Manual lists them as having eggs, though, as they are mammals who would logically give live birth. At least that's what My Little Pony taught me.Hippogriff (2000 gp for egg, 3000 gp for foal, 1000 gp to train) [SRD]If you can't have a pegasus, you can use the slightly slower Hippogriff.Griffon (3500 gp for egg, 7000 gp for young, 1500 gp to train) [SRD]The griffon has more HP than the pegasus, but has a fly speed of 80 feet. It has significantly improved combat abilities, but you hopefully won't need them.Spider Eater (2000 gp for egg, 3000 gp for young, 3000 gp to train) [SRD]The Spider Eater costs quite a lot to train. In return, you get a mount with a 60 ft fly speed at good manevuerability, and a constant Freedom of Movement effect on itself, which is pretty handy to have. FeatsMounted Combat FeatsMounted Combat [SRD] - Requires Ride: 1 rankThis is the core feat for Mounted Combat. Not only do many classes specializing in Mounted Combat require this, but this also allows you to keep your Mount quite safe; you can use your Ride-check instead of the Mount's AC once per round and pimping out checks is very easy.Mounted Archery [SRD] - Requires Mounted Combat, Ride: 1 rankHalves the penalties for firing atop a moving mount. Since being able to move while shooting is the only real reason for Mounted Archery in the first place, this feat is very much worth your trouble. Makes penalties 2 points lower when the mount is double moving and 4 points lower when the mount is running. Really handy overall.Improved Mounted Archery [CW Pg. 101] - Requires Mounted Combat, Mounted Archery, Ride: 1 rankRemoves penalties for shooting atop a moving mount, reduces the penalties for shooting atop a running mount to -2, allows you to shoot at any point during the mount's movement (normally you must take the shots halfway through). If you've come this far, you may as well take this; being able to shoot at whatever point in the movement really makes a difference in restricted terrains such as dungeons and the lack of penalties is very much worth it if you already took Mounted Archery; may as well remove the penalties entirely.Mounted Fighting [DR346 Pg. 86] - Requires Mounted Combat, BAB +8, Ride: 11 ranksThis feat gives you +1 to hit and to damage on attacks made atop of a mount. A decent option if you've got feats to spare (seems highly unlikely though), but the bonuses are quite minor so it's not a high priority feat. Luckily it has effectively no prerequisites to speak of so you're fine in that regard; this feat wouldn't be worth going through loops for, but as it stands, I could see some builds picking it up eventually.Tunnel Riding [RoS Pg. 145] - Requires Mounted Combat, Tunnel Fighting [RoS Pg. 145]Tunnel Fighting requires +1 BAB, so effectively you can't gain this before that either. Anyways, this feat can be very useful if you expect Dungeons and still want to use a Mount; with this and Tunnel Fighting, you and your mount can fight with no penalties when squeezing through narrow spaces. Normally you take -4 to attacks and AC, but with this you and your Large mount have no problems travelling corridors planned for Medium creatures. In the same vein, the Halfling and his mount have no trouble riding in corridors built for Small creatures. Yes, squeezing still costs 2 squares of movement, but your Mount has movement to spare and since you can fight without trouble when squeezing, feel free to bide your time. The only problem with this feat is the prerequisite; finding two spare feats for a Mounted Archer is a challenge of epic proportions. Otherwise this would be in blue.Trample [SRD] - Requires Mounted Combat, Ride: 1 rankNow, the wording on Overrun is a bit unclear, but it seems like your Mount can charge without you spending actions on it allowing you to keep shooting (it would probably count as running though), and that would allow your mount to make Overruns on the opponents. In that case, Trample can very much be worth it for hooving the Overran opponents in the face. It helps that your Mount tends to be strong and large.Mount FeatsLeadership [SRD] - Requires Character Level 6thI'll get it out of the way - this is the most powerful feat in D&amp;amp;D. In fact, it's so powerful that when allowed in its full extent, Charisma suddenly becomes a pivotal stat for every class. However, the use suggested here isn't anything broken; I actually suggest you ask if you can skip the follower nonsense entirely when using it to acquire a Mount (that way the feat will be a bit more fair and you don't have a bunch of rabble getting in your way), possibly renaming it to &quot;Acquire Mount&quot; or something to that effect. Followers are generally used for Circle Magic, Aid Another and similar effects that get broken real fast when any sorts of numbers are present. If you can't get rid of them, have them build a castle or something. You've only got interest in the Cohort (although the highest level followers can be useful enough to keep along, especially if you're playing a Charisma-focused character). You can have your Cohort be either a Druid or some kind of an intelligent ridable creature, such as a Dragon, a Centaur, a Pegasus or similar.Note that Leadership is derived off your Charisma-score, so if using this to acquire a mount, make sure you've got high enough Charisma to acquire a strong one.This along with Wild Cohort is the only way to get a mount growing in power without devoting most of your class levels towards the goal. As such, if you're an aspiring Mounted Archer of a class that does not have a natural Animal Companion/Mount progression, this is probably the best route to take provided that you can spare the Charisma (16 Cha will get you max. level Cohort up to level 14; after that you need either other factors or items to improve Cha to keep it maxed; on level 19 you need Cha 20 for maxed Cohort, so if your core Cha is 14, you'll be able to max it out without depending on Reputation or needing to read Books). This is also the only Core-only feat for Mount acquisition.As a bonus, Leadership also qualifies you to a whole direction of character construction and a ton of other feats (among others, Improved Cohort [HoB Pg. 98], which allows you to cap your Cohort one level below you as opposed to two levels). Heroes of Battle is a good source for Leadership-based abilities, but it's all beyond the scope of this Handbook. Also note that when going to Epic, Epic Leadership [SRD] allows you to continue Cohort-progression beyond level 20.Wild Cohort [WoTC Site] - No prerequisitesIf you're playing a character that doesn't naturally get an animal companion, this gets you one. On early levels, it's a perfectly able combatant and as it does advance decently by levels, it'll remain useful at least as a mount throughout your career. This also just so happens to kick Ranger's animal companions ass - just an additional reason to trade it away. So yes, right here you've got a feat that allows you to acquire a perfectly usable Mount as any class.This is cleaner than Leadership, less broken, and doesn't require any Charisma out of you so much of the time picking Wild Cohort will be less hassle. You might want to pick Natural Bond later to improve your companion a bit though.Devoted Tracker [CAdv Pg. 108] - Requires Track, smite evil, wild empathyThis feat combines Ranger and Paladin-progressions, and allows you to designate your Special Mount as your Animal Companion, stacking the benefits. Thanks to the fact that Ranger isn't the only class with Animal Companion, it does much more than just stacks Ranger and Paladin. This feat allows you to take levels in Halfling Outrider PrC [CW Pg. 38] to effectively get two levels of advancement for your Mount per one level of Halfling Outrider!This is what the so-called &quot;Supermount&quot;-builds are based on and is the source of tremendously powerful Mounts, ones that can put the rider to shame, especially combined with other feats in this chapter. When going for a strong Mount, this is the first thing to go for. Remember that it ties a lot of class levels to truly work out though.Celestial Mount [BoED Pg. 42] - Requires Paladin Level 4th, ExaltedThis gives your Mount the Celestial-template. This includes minor Spell Resistance (5+HD; Devoted Tracker means he'll have lots of HD though so it'll be fine until it caps at 25), minor Damage Reduction (X/Magic, rather trivial, but gives the Mount's natural weapons the ability to bypass DR/Magic too), 60' Darkvision and some Energy Resistances. It isn't an incredible template by any stretch of imagination, but it allows you to make unintelligent companions intelligent (raises Int to 3 if it's lower than that) and if you have feats to spare, might as well. It isn't horrible. It's Exalted though so beware if you aren't Very Good.Holy Mount [DR325 Pg. 62] - Requires Special Mount class feature, any other Divine caster classThis allows you to stack your Paladin-levels with the Divine casting class in question to determine the abilities of your Mount. Great for attaining a strong mount without taking excess levels in a rather weak class such as Paladin; goes even better with Prestige Paladin [SRD], of which you only need to take two levels to qualify for the Mount, and which advances the spellcasting of any Divine caster class you take. After that you can go straight Cleric or similar. In Supermount-builds, this is usually used to stack e.g. Ranger-levels with Paladin-levels to get two levels worth of Mount every time you get one level in Outrider. This is solid even when not going for those 50HD Mounts.Theurgic Mount [DR325 Pg. 62] - Requires Special Mount class feature, any Arcane caster classThis allows you to stack your Paladin-levels with the Arcane casting class in question to determine the abilities of your Mount. This is usually used to stack Paladin with Fey Bard to take levels in Animal Companion and Mount at the same time. With this, you basically turn Halfling Outrider into: Every level, your Mount advances 3 levels and your Animal Companion two - you just need a level in Druidish class (Beastmaster [CAdv Pg. 26]), Rangerish class (Prestige Ranger [SRD]), Paladinish class (Prestige Paladin [SRD]) and you may as well top it off with another Druidish class (Fey Bard [SRD]) that stacks with Beastmaster and thus stacks with Paladin for Mount through Halfling Outrider thanks to Theurgic Mount. Note that not all DMs are going to allow them to stack as written, limiting it by your HD. Even then this feat allows you to have a fully powered up Mount off a class that normally has no Mount advancement; well worth the investment.Dragon Cohort [Drac Pg. 104] - Requires Character Level 9th, Speak Language: DraconicThis is an alternative to Leadership for those who wish to become dragonriders! Dragon Cohort has none of the associated Followers-nonsense that comes with Leadership and the list of Cohorts is limited, as the name suggests, to Dragons only. Basically, this feat allows you to cut 3 levels of adjustment away from the effective Cohort-level of the Dragon Ally you want; this allows you to have a Cohort of adjusted level up to 20 (for example, Young Gold Dragon) by the end of the progression. Otherwise it's identical to Leadership in that you again need some Charisma to attract a Cohort of certain level, and that the Cohort doesn't take a part of your Experience, etc. This is very good, easily the best lone investment for attaining a Mount of sufficient power level (although Leadership is of course the more powerful feat; that's another reason this is better, this is actually likely to be allowed). Note that Dragons have the Alternate Form-ability, which allows them to assume a medium Human or Animal-form to accompany you to places where they normally wouldn't fit. You can have them take a Medium Animal-form to ride in a dungeon, for example (you can also get Shrink Person on you if need be).Dragon Steed [Drac Pg. 105] - Requires Cha 13, Ride: 8 ranks, Speak Language: DraconicThis feat allows you to get a loyal Dragonnel [Drac Pg. 151] mount, much like you'd get a Cohort. This isn't very impressive; Dragonnels aren't earthshattering to any degree. However, the true use of this feat is that a Paladin picking this feat can trade his Special Mount for a Draconic Mount! Initially it's just Dragonnel, but with a couple of levels (level 12th gets you a Wyrmling Gold, although if you're Medium you'll need to wait until effective level 16 to get Very Young Gold) under your belt, you can get a True Dragon as your Mount! Now, this requires you to enable it to build a lair and to give it 1000gp per HD worth of treasure, but who cares! You're riding a Dragon! Also, you can make your Cohort your Mount to stack stuff. Stacking stuff tends to lead to very powerful builds.Natural Bond [CAdv Pg. 111] - Requires Animal companionArchers multiclass a lot. Builds that fool around pimping out their Mount tend to multiclass even more. This here feat allows you to make up for the multiclassing and pick up extra effective level to pump up your companion with. Thanks to Devoted Tracker, you can make your companion your Mount and thus pretty much directly apply the +3 adjustment to your Mount/Companion, since the levels you used to gain the Mount are probably levels that did not advance your Companion, thus giving you the HD to apply Natural Bond-adjustment.Theurgic Bond [DR325 Pg. 62] - Requires Ability to gain an animal companion, Ability to gain a familiarThis feat allows you to either add your Familiar-levels to advancing your Animal Companion or your Animal Companion-levels to advancing your Familiar. Can be handy if you have Arcane casting levels, but due to the fact that there are precious few dual advancement classes for Familiar and Animal companion, not quite as potent as the other combination feats available. Still, it's very handy for multiclassing into Arcane classes while maintaining your Animal companion's potency. Mounted combatants will probably not be applying this to their Familiars though.Martial Archers With Bow let us win cattle, with Bow the battle, with Bow be victors in our hot encounters.The Bow brings grief and sorrow to the foeman: armed with the Bow may we subdue all regions.-The Rig-Veda, Mandala 6, Hymn 75OverviewRangers and Fighters are the most obvious Archer-classes in the Player's Handbook. As such, it's really annoying that both, Fighter 20 and Ranger 20 make for rather poor archers in the long run. A straight Fighter has somewhat better overall damage, while a Ranger has the necessary skills down and performs quite well against their Favored Enemies, but they're overall quite poor archers right out of the box. Make no mistake, a martial Archer is going to want to multiclass. Otherwise it's just nowhere near the potency of magically enhanced archers or martial melee. This is further compounded by the fact that 3.5 doesn't really have that much in terms of good Archer Prestige Classes so that's not a doable escape either.Therefore, this section is not going to go into great deal of depth as to how to build an effective straight-classed Fighter or Ranger Archers simply because that's not going to happen. I'll spare a few words for the awesome Targetteer Fighter, but even then, you're better off multiclassing, and I'm going to refer to 3.0 Prestige Classes practically constantly. Basically, Weapon Supremacy just isn't all that good for archers (as archery in D&amp;amp;D relies on volleys for damage on higher levels).Now, when it comes to Barbarians, things get interesting.The default Barbarian isn't suited for archery, but he does have access to Whirling Frenzy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A barbarian with this variant form of rage doesn't gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, when a barbarian with whirling frenzy enters a rage, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling frenzy, the barbarian may make one extra attack in a round at his highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the barbarian might make before his next action.Whirling Frenzy is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all other ways. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Strength bonus increases to +6, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +3. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Strength bonus increases to +8, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +4.A barbarian using this variant doesn't gain indomitable will at 14th level. Instead, he gains evasion, but only while in a whirling frenzy.A character can't use whirling frenzy at the same time that he uses any other form of rage (or similar ability).Screw you, Rapid Shot! Whirling Frenzy is where it's at!The main downsides are the limited number of times you can rage and the duration of the rage, but that can be easily addressed with the proper race selection, ability score allocation, feat choices, and multiclassing.The bonus to Strength is also handy, and helps alleviate some of the MAD faced by archers. You'll want one of the bows that automatically adjusts to your Strength modifier to make the best use of this.Building a Martial ArcherSome of us just want to play a guy who's really good with a bow. He wins because he's just better with the weapon than anyone else on any plane of existence. This section examines just how you should go about creating an efficient martial archer. First, remember that the primary issue when building any archer is dealing decent damage on higher levels. When opponents only have 4 HP a piece, dealing an average of 4.5 damage per hit is just fine, but unlike in melee, a ranged character does not have Power Attack to pump their damage output later on and when dealing with opponents having 200+ HP, dealing 15 damage per hit with 5 shots per turn is going to take long while to kill anything, especially if they have DR. Further, they either need a different stat for damage and to hit (straight bows), or can only add half their to hit-stat to damage (crossbows), which causes even more issues as far as raising the damage goes.With that said, let's get down to business:Most Martial Archers want some means to gain Weapon Specialization to qualify for Ranged Weapon Mastery. The two feats give you a very real damage increase, and really improve your overall performance as an archer.Generally, you'll want to at least dip a class that gains Spot as a class skill (Ranger is great), since a straight Martial Archer has no range-related bonuses beyond Point Blank Shot and therefore, you want to be able to engage the opponent from as far away as possible.Try to find some means to gain the ability to make Power Shots (to use Power Attack with a ranged weapon). The easiest means to gain it is to buy an Energy Bow (covered in Traditional Archery -&amp;gt; Equipment), but you could also ask if the Peerless Archer Prestige Class is available, or if you could homebrew the feat (since that'd be quite logical).Do try to maximize the enhancements of your bow. Having a +1 bow with +9 worth of special abilities with Greater Magic Weapon cast on it, a weapon crystal and using enhanced arrows is going to go a long way towards dealing the damage on higher levels. Feats (covered in Archery General) are generally the most efficient means to do this, although Kensai-levels can accomplish this as well. Of course, you'll wish to have a party crafter around if possible.Martial Archers are feat starved. And martial classes are often not great in terms of long term feat rewards. Try to get as many bonus feats as possible.Prestige classes to aim for are Deepwood Sniper, Peerless Archer, or the Sword and Fist version of Order of the Bow Initiate. Perhaps Exotic Weapon Master if you've picked up an exotic bow.You can maximize the number of useful feats and skill points with martial classes is to take 2 levels of Ranger for Combat Style: Rapid Shot and a generous amount of skill points, then dip two levels of fighter for bonus feats. This allows you to maximize the number of attacks you can make in a round.Be sure your GM doesn't enforce multiclassing penalties if you want to dip Barbarian. If he does, you'll need to take extra Barbarian levels. Barbarian 2 isn't too bad, since you get Uncanny Dodge. Barbarian 3 grants Trapsense +1, which can thankfully be traded out for the Spell Sense ACF [CM Pg. 35], which grants your Trapsense bonus to your AC as a dodge bonus against spells and SLAs. It's not huge, but it's better than nothing.Ranger can be useful for up to two more levels. Another level of Ranger gets you a good number of skill points and Endurance, which qualifies you for Horizon Walker. Immunity to Fatigue from Whirling Frenzy's not a bad, Darkvision helps, and Dimension Door is very useful. 6 levels of Horizon Walker is not a bad diversion while you work on qualifying for archery prestige classes. (&quot;I will teleport around shooting you in the face in the dark without ever feeling tired &quot; worked pretty well in Diablo 2) It's certainly better than some archery prestige classes that could be named.At level 4, Ranger enables you to swap out your animal companion for the Distracting Attack ACF [PHBII Pg. 55], which allows you and your allies to treat whenever you hit an enemy with a weapon attack (whether melee or ranged), as flanked on the next attack he is subjected to. It's not the most powerful ability, but it could be handy in the right kind of party.A great Ranger ACF to take is the Arcane Hunter ACF [CM Pg .32] for the Ranger. In exchange for one rank in Knowledge: Arcana, you get Favored Enemy: Arcanists. Anything that casts arcane spells or SLAs is now your prey. Pretty handy.There's nothing to be said for Fighter level 3 (it is dumb level, Thog not take), but Fighter 4 nets you another feat and qualifies you for Weapon Specialization, a prerequisite for Ranged Weapon Mastery. Ranged Weapon Mastery is not the most amazing feat, but it's quite a nice option.There is a Fighter ACF that works great for archers, the Hit-and-Run Drow Fighter ACF [DotU Pg. 58] grants a +2 untyped initiative bonus and Dex to damage against flat-footed enemies within 30 feet in exchange for heavy armor and tower shield proficiency. Sounds like a win-win.The Martial Rogue and Cloistered Cleric from Unearthed Arcana are good options for extra feats, although neither are, strictly speaking, martial classes.There is a mini-guide to selecting Cloistered Cleric domains for fun and profit in the Divine section of the guide if this interests you.I must admit, I am partial to an Arcane Hunter Ranger 2/Hit-and-Run Fighter 4 with the feats Education (1), Knowledge Devotion (3), Weapon Focus (6), Rapid Shot (Ranger 2), Point Blank Shot (Fighter 1), Precise Shot (Fighter 2), Weapon Specialization (Fighter 4). Next comes 2 levels of Barbarian for Whirling Frenzy and Uncanny Dodge. Grab an extra level Ranger and use the Endurance to qualify for Horizon Walker. Take Ranged Weapon Mastery. Throw Quicken SLA on Dimension Door. Have fun. &quot;I will teleport around shooting you with arrows in the face and never getting tired of it&quot; worked in Diablo 2 and it will work here!-SoloIt may seem odd that I don't really recommend an archery prestige class for an archer, but most of the options aren't worthwhile. Let's take a look.Deepwood Sniper [MotW]RequirementsBase Attack Bonus: +5Skills: Hide 4 ranks, Move Silently 4 ranks, Spot 4 ranks.Feats: Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Weapon Focus (any bow or crossbow).At first level, the critical threat range of arrows increases by 1, and the range increment of a bow or crossbow increases by 10ft/level.At second level, you reduce your miss chance against an opponent by 10% (and by an additional 10% per four Deepwood Sniper levels). Once per day, the Deepwood Sniper's bow can be affected as if by a Magic Weapon spell. The Damage critical multiplier of arrows or bolts fired increases by 1.At third level, you get safe poison use. LAME!At fourth level, you get a small bonus to attack as long as you spend a full round aiming, and the victim stands still. Any ability that can be foiled by the enemy walking at a brisk pace is LOW ENERGY!At fifth level, you get the ability to reroll an attack roll once per day. SAD!No new abilities until 10th level, where you get to produce a True Strike effect once per day. DISAPPOINTING!Judgement: This prestige class runs out of steam after two levels. It offers a few useful minor benefits in exchange for a mediocre feat. It's not a bad investment for two levels, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.Peerless Archer [SM]Requirements:Base Attack Bonus: +7Skills: Craft (bowmaking) 10 ranksFeats: Point Blank Shot, Far Shot, Precise Shot, Quick DrawProficiency: Longbow, shortbow, composite longbow, or composite shortbowAt first level, you gain what is essentially Skill Focus: Craft Bow. You also gain +1d6 ranged sneak attack, which is probably the more useful ability. The sneak attack increases by +1d6 every 3 levels hereafter, to a maximum of +4d6 at level 10. Not bad.At second level, you reduce the level of concealment enemies have by one step, and can craft magic arrows as if you had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat. You start off making +1 arrows, which increases by +1 every 2 levels thereafter, to a maximum of +5 at 10th level. You don't get the ability to add weapon enchantments (eg Splitting, Force), so this isn't that useful, especially if you have a someone in the party willing to cast Greater Magic Weapon.At third level, you gain the Power Shot ability. Finally, ranged Power Attack! This is very useful.No new abilities until 8th level, where you get the Threaten ability which allows you to treat your bow as if it were a 10ft reach weapon.Judgement: Just take Deadly Aim and wield a bowstaff.Order of the Bow Initiate [S&amp;amp;F]RequirementsBase Attack Bonus: +5Skills: Knowledge (religion) 2 ranksFeats: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow or shortbow), Weapon Specialization (longbow or shortbow)Proficiency: Longbow or shortbow or composite longbow or composite shortbow.At first level, you get +1d6 range sneak attack, which increases as you take more levels. Why do all these ranged prestige classes give you an ability that only works at close range? It's not bad, it's just not that useful given the limitations. You want to shoot people in the face from far away, not within charging distance At second level, your attacks with a ranged weapon in a threatened area and not provoke an attack of opportunity. This is pretty awesome, although it'd be best if you weren't in melee to begin with.At level four, you get Superior Weapon Focus: an additional +1 to attack rolls with a bow, This one must have taken a lot of creativity and effort. At level six, you get a free attack at any enemy who is subject to an AoO from an ally, and the Zen Archery feat. It's a bit late to get Zen Archery as a bonus feat, as anyone who needs it would have taken it by now, but this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that anyone who did take it now benefits from adding his Dexterity modifier and his Wisdom modifier for ranged attacks. At seventh level, you gain Superior Weapon Specialization, an additional +2 to damage rolls with a bow. Truly one of the most attractive features of this class!At ninth level, you gain the Banked Shot ability. This allows you to fire an arrow at a target within 20 feet of a wall (but not adjacent to the wall) and treat the target as if flat-footed for purposes of AC and damage inflicted as a full-round action. This is both practically and impractically useless.Judgement: Either leave at level 2 or level 6, It's fortunate that the prerequisites are likely things you'll have taken anyways, so it's easy to get into when you have nothing better to do.Order of the Bow Initiate [CW]RequirementsBase Attack Bonus: +5Skills: Craft (bowmaking) 5 ranks , Knowledge (religion) 2 ranksFeats: Point Blank Shot , Precise Shot , Rapid Shot , Weapon Focus (longbow, shortbow, or composite version of either)At first level, you get Ranged Precision. This is much like the 3.0 ability Ranged Sneak Attack, except that you must use a standard action to deliver a single attack to an enemy within 30 feet that deals +1d8 precision damage, which increases by +1d8 every 2 levels to a maximum of +5d8 at 9th level. At least the target does not need to be denied its Dexterity bonus or be flat-footed in order to take this damage.At second level, you gain Close Combat Shot. This is much the same as the 3.0 version, so not much needs to be said.At fourth level, you gain Greater Weapon Focus. A rose by any other name.At level 6, you gain the Sharp Shooting feat. It's bad.At 10th level, you double the distance at which you can use Ranged Precision.Judgement: This version is only good for two levels, and only if you really want to shoot people up close.Exotic Weapon MasterRequirementsBase Attack Bonus: +6Skills: Craft (Weaponsmithing) 3 ranksFeats: Exotic Weapon Proficiency (any exotic weapon) , Weapon Focus (any exotic weapon)Special: Races that have familiarity with an exotic weapon (such as the dwarf's familiarity with the dwarven waraxe and the dwarven urgrosh) are considered to have the Exotic Weapon Proficiency feat for the purpose of meeting the requirements for this class.Each of the three levels of Exotic Weapon Master allows you to choose a stunt. The most useful ones are:Close-Quarters Ranged Combat – You don't provoke an attack of opportunity when using an exotic ranged weapon.Ranged Disarm – You can make a disarm attempt on a ranged attack.Twin Exotic Weapon Fighting: lessens TWF penalties when using exotic weapons, such as hand crossbows. (But good luck getting the feats to pull off crossbows.)Judgement: Short, easy to qualify for, and grants a Close Combat Shot.equivalent faster than OotBI.FeatsRanged Weapon Mastery [PHBII Pg. 82] - Requires Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, BAB +8A feat that makes Weapon Focus-tree almost worth taking. +2 to hit AND damage (with one damage type) is very good for just one feat and you get a range increase on top of that! It also requires Weapon Specialization, but not any actual Fighter-levels, so if you can get Weapon Specialization through means other than Fighter-levels (for example Pious Templar [CD Pg. 50] gets it as a bonus feat), you also qualify for Ranged Weapon Mastery. A very handy damage, range, and To Hit increase.Skirmish ArchersMove as swiftly as the Wind, be as supple as the Forest.Attack as fiercely as Fire, be as firm as the Mountain.Be as mysterious as a Shadow, strike as fast as Lightning.-Sun Tzu, The Art of War OverviewSkirmishing was always a tactic in Dungeons and Dragons, but the Complete Adventurer's Scout class was the first to be built around the concept. Its skirmish ability adds bonus damage dice to attacks made after moving. However, there were few ways to gain iterative attacks after moving, and Skirmish explicitly does not work with mounted archery.&amp;nbsp;All that changed in 2007, with the release of two books. But more on those laterBuilding a Skirmish ArcherThere are a few things to keep in mind when building a skirmisher.You are no longer Strength dependent to deal damage. Unfortunately, this also means that you must now contend with creatures who are immune to precision damage – and unlike the Rogue, you do not have any means of overcoming this on your own.You have a good amount of skills, which means that maneuvering and spotting enemies will be easy.Generating multiple attacks is key to a high damage output. You want Rapid Shot. You want Manyshot. You want Splitting.You must be able to move around and take full attacks. Ideally, you will have multiple ways.This is pointed out in the Precision Archer section later, but don't forget the Hunter's Eye spell from the Player's Handbook II! It is a swift action 2nd level Ranger spell which grants +1d6 Sneak Attack for ever 3 caster levels. Feats Swift Hunter [CS,&amp;nbsp; Pg. 81] – Requires Skirmish +1d6/+1 AC, Favored EnemyThis is the most important feat to take when building a Skirmisher. It allows you to stack Scout and Ranger levels for determining the extra damage and bonus to Armor Class granted when skirmishing, and allowed the use of Skirmish on Favored Enemies even if they were immune to precision damage.Swift Ambusher [CS, Pg. 81] – Requires Skirmish +1d6, Sneak Attack +1d6This allows your Rogue and Scout levels to stack for the purpose of determining the extra damage and bonus to Armor Class granted when skirmishing. A Swift Ambusher is a perfectly viable build, but needs another way to overcome immunities to precision damage. See the next section for details! Travel Devotion [CC, Pg. 62] – No prerequisitesThe Travel Devotion feat allows movement up to the user's movement speed as a swift action once per day, with additional uses costing 2 Turn Undead attempts each. What makes this truly outstanding is the fact Complete Champion also allows Clerics to trade in their domains for the corresponding devotion feat. Thus, a single level dip in Cloistered Cleric [SRD] will net a Skirmisher the Travel domain, which can be traded in for Travel Devotion, the Knowledge Domain, which may be turned in for Knowledge Devotion, one bonus domain, which could be the Elf Domain for Point Blank Shot or the War Domain for a Weapon Proficiency feat and a Weapon Focus feat, Turn Undead attempts to fuel Devotion feats, and spellcasting.ItemsAnklets of Translocation (1400 gp) [MiC, Pg. 71]These little trinkets let you use a swift action to teleport up to 10ft away twice per day. They're exactly what the doctor ordered!Bracers of Murder (8000 gp) [DotU, Pg. 98]These bracers grant you a +2 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls if the target is flat-footed. Furthermore, you may reroll any ones on your Sneak Attack or Sudden Strike. If you have Death Attack, your DC increases by 2 points.Chronocharm of the Horizon Walker (500 gp) [MiC Pg. 86]This allows you to use a swift action to move up to half your speed (rounded down) without provoking attacks of opportunity. A good compliment to the Anklets of TranslocationQuicksilver Boots (3500 gp) [MiC Pg. 119]The boots allow you to use a swift action to move up to your movement speed, even over water or terrain you normally wouldn't be able to walk over, but you will provoke attacks of opportunity – at least you get concealment while moving under its effects. This ability functions twice per day.Prestige ClassesUnseen Seer [CM, Pg. 81]Requirements:Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Search 8 ranks, Sense Motive 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, Spot 8 ranksSpellcasting: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells, including at least two divination spells.This class has 3/4th BAB, 10/10 spellcasting progression, advances damage for Sneak Attack, Sudden Strike, or Skirmish, grants additional Divination spells known (including ones from Divine spell lists, like Hunter's Eye), increases the caster level of Divination spells, grants the Silent Spell feat, and continual nondetection. See the Divine Archer and Arcane Archer sections for spells recommendations.This class can work for the Skirmish Archer, either through levels of Assassin, by having the Ranger take the Sword of the Arcane Order feat so he can cast Wizard spells, or by taking levels in Mystic Ranger [DR#336, Pg. 105]Additional LinksFor more detailed information, see the Swift Hunter Handbook.Precision ArchersStand and deliver!OverviewPrecision archery is an appealing choice: Precision damage can add up quickly, and the classes themselves are often stealth and skill focused, so they can be quite versatile overall. In addition, this type of archery works well within the dungeon, where mobility may be hindered, and hiding spaces plentiful.Building a Precision ArcherClasses that grant Precision damage are often sneaky, so catching an enemy flat-footed is not the issue.Reliably denying them their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class afterward is. In addition, archers must find a way around enemies immune to precision damage. Once these are dealt with, the Sneak Attack archer becomes a potent damage dealer.A few major points, then. You must emphasize stealth so that you can maximize your chances of sneak attacking enemies. Strongly consider the Darkstalker feat.A high Initiative score is vital for going first after a surprise attack, since the enemy is flat-footed until their turn starts. [Relevant OoTS]Wands are your friend. The Gravestrike, Vinestrike, and Golemstrike spells from the Spell Compendium are swift action first level spells allow the caster to bypass the immunity to precision damage for undead, plants, and constructs, respectively.The Sniper's Shot spell is another swift action first level spell from the Spell Compendium that removes the distance cap on precision damage for one round.The Hunter's Eye spell from the Player's Handbook II is a swift action 2nd level Ranger spell which grants +1d6 Sneak Attack for ever 3 caster levels.The Grease spell forces an enemy without 5 ranks in the Balance skill to balance, rendering them flat-footed. Or it might cause them to fall prone, which is also good.The Hit-and-Run Fighter ACF [DotU, Pg. 58] replaces the Fighter's 1st level proficiency with heavy armor and shields (even affecting those gained by previous classes) for a +2 bonus to initiative and the ability to add the Fighter's Dexterity modifier as a competence bonus to damage rolls on enemies within 30 feet.FeatsCraven [CoR Pg. 17] – Cannot be immune to fear, must have Sneak AttackYou are cowardly enough to warrant a -2 penalty on saves against fear, but you are also willing to fight dirty and deal an extra point of sneak attack damage for each character level you have. As this is a static bonus, it can be multiplied on a critical hit.Deadly Precision [SRD] – Dexterity 15, BAB +5This feat allows you to reroll any result of 1 on your sneak attack’s extra damage dice, but you must keep the result of the reroll, even if it is another 1. You likely don't have an open feat for this, and Craven is better anyways.Prestige ClassesArcane Trickster [SRD]RequirementsAlignment: Any nonlawful.Skills: Decipher Script 7 ranks, Disable Device 7 ranks, Escape Artist 7 ranks, Knowledge (arcana) 4 ranks.Spells: Ability to cast mage hand and at least one arcane spell of 3rd level or higher.Special: Sneak attack +2d6.The Arcane Trickster requires Rogue entry and advances Sneak Attack as well as spellcasting, but offers only 1/2 BAB progression. You get to declare Impromptu Sneak Attacks, which might be handy. Assassin [SRD]Requirements:Alignment: Any EvilSkills: Disguise 4 ranks, Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks Not archery focused, but it does give you some useful abilities, such as Poison Use, Hide in Plain Sight, Sneak Attack advancement, and spells from a decent list. For bonus points, they do get Sniper's Shot and Arrowsplit. (See the Ranger spell section under the Shapeshift Archer for details.)Avenger [WotC April Fools Joke]Alignment: Any GoodSkills: Disguise 4 ranks, Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks This is an alignment flipped Assassin used to show DMs how to refluff and adapt prestige classes for different campaigns.Dread Commando [HoB, Pg. 103]Requirements:Base Attack Bonus: +5Skills: Hide 6 ranks , Move Silently 6 ranksFeats: Dodge,&amp;nbsp; MobilityThe Dread Commando gains Sudden Strike, which is like Sneak Attack restricted to targets denied their Dexterity bonus to AC, but that's not a problem since you aren't flanking anyone. You also grant yourself and nearby allies a competence bonus to initiative equal to your class level and reduce penalties for sneaking around and sneaking in armor.The only problem is that it requires two feats that you may not have room for. The Mobility armor property can help with one of those, but you're out of luck for the other. If you do decide to take this class, you may want to take Expeditious Dodge [RotW, Pg. 150], which grants a flat +2 Dodge bonus to AC for one turn when you move 40 feet or more.Skullclan Hunter [MinH, Pg. 20]Requirements:Alignment: Any Good Skills: Knowledge (religion) 8 ranksSpecial: Ability to turn undead, sneak attack +2d6This becomes blue in an undead heavy campaign, as it lets you deal full damage to undead with your Sneak Attack starting at level 2. It also advances sneak attack, grants various immunities, constant Protection from Evil, and allows you to overcome the Damage Reduction of undead, as well as attack incoporeal undead. It's probably not worth going for all those abilities, though; 3-4 levels should get you all that you need.Unseen Seer [CM, Pg. 81]Requirements:Skills: Hide 8 ranks, Search 8 ranks, Sense Motive 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, Spot 8 ranksSpellcasting: Ability to cast 1st-level arcane spells, including at least two divination spells.This class has 3/4th BAB, 10/10 spellcasting progression, advances damage for Sneak Attack, Sudden Strike, or Skirmish, grants additional Divination spells known (including ones from Divine spell lists, like Hunter's Eye), increases the caster level of Divination spells, grants the Silent Spell feat, and continual nondetection. This is a really solid class for the Precision archer. See the Divine Archer and Arcane Archer sections for spells recommendations.Interesting note: You can qualify for this through Assassin.&amp;nbsp; ItemsBracers of Murder (8000 gp) [DotU, Pg. 98]These bracers grant you a +2 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls if the target is flat-footed. Furthermore, you may reroll any ones on your Sneak Attack or Sudden Strike. If you have Death Attack, your DC increases by 2 points.Marbles (2 sp) [AE, Pg. 24]These force a DC 15 Balance check in a 5 foot square when thrown, rendering them a cheap and worthwhile alternative to the Grease spell. It'll be sure to make the enemy lose their marbles!Ring of Blinking (27000 gp) [SRD]Not only is this good for the many benefits of the Blink spell, but it also allows you to strike as an invisible creature, denying your enemies their Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and making them susceptible to Sneak Attack! Attacks made while Blinking have a 20% miss chance for you, but I'd argue that an archer is exempt because once you let go of an object (like an arrow), it is no longer affected by Blink and returns to the Material Plane.If your DM rules that this is not the case, a Ring of Blinking is still rather useful, and can now be used to dispose of evidence.Wand Chamber (100 gp) [DS Pg. 34]&amp;nbsp;This weapon modification allows a weapon to hold one wand inside of it.Greater Weapon Crystals of Demolition, Truedeath (10000 gp) [MiC]These allow you to sneak attack constructs and undead, respectively. Worth it if you have no other way. Wands are cheaper, though.Sublime Way ArchersIn archery we have something of the way of the superior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he turns around and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.-Confucius&amp;nbsp; OverviewAs a whole, Tome of Battle emulates wuxia stories, but has little interest in archery, which is a shame, as archery features in Chinese folklore and history. Although Tome of Battle is geared towards melee combat, an archer may make use of some of its material.Building a Sublime ArcherClass wise, you have the choice of either going Warblade and building a Martial Archer, or using the Swordsage to build a Precision Archer. When it comes to maneuvers, the main thing to look out for maneuvers and stances which do not require you to hit someone with a melee weapon. Let's take a look at our options!Desert WindBlistering Flourish (1st level Strike) – Doesn't require a melee attack, but also an inconsequential debuff.Distracting Ember (1st level Boost) – Summoning a small fire elemental isn't specifically helpful to archery. You can use him to block enemies set off traps, and make tea, though.Flame's Blessing (1st level Stance) – Fire resistance isn't bad, but isn't that useful either.Wind Stride (1st level Boost) – A bonus to movement speed could be handy depending on your playstyle.Fan the Flames (3rd level Strike) – You launch a Hadoken at an enemy within 30 feet, dealing 6d6 fire damage with a ranged touch attack. It can be used for Sneak Attacks, but isn't that great overall.Holocaust Cloak (3rd level Stance) – The stance might be worth considering for emergencies if it did more damage to your attackers or wasn't negated by a reach weapon.Zephyr Dance (3rd level Counter) – A +4 Dodge bonus to AC against a single attack as an immediate action isn't too bad.Firesnake (4th level Strike) – It can certainly make it harder for enemies to get close to you.Leaping Flame (5th level Counter) – You probably don't want to teleport next to an enemy as an archer. You can teleport next to an ally if they attack you, but that's too convoluted for my taste.Rising Phoenix (8th level Stance) – You get to hover a bit. Not impressive in the late game.Devoted SpiritAura of Perfect Order (6th level Stance)– It may be useful to treat a D20 as having rolled an 11, but I can't find two other Devoted Spirit maneuvers to take for the prerequisites.Immortal Fortitude (8th level Stance) – Not dying from hitpoint damage is great, but there's so many other ways to die at this level. And there's no way to fill the prerequisites with anything useful.&amp;nbsp;Diamond MindMoment of Perfect Mind (1st level Counter) – This could be a lifesafer against illusions, blinding, mind control, etc.Stance of Clarity (1st level Stance) – Situational. Only useful when you have more to worry from enemy archers than melee.Action Before Thought (2nd level Counter) – You should have high Dexterity, but you can take this if you're still worried about Reflex saves.Mind Over Body (3rd level Counter) – It be used to shore up a Fortitude save, if you skimped out on Constitution.Pearl of Black Doubt (3rd level Stance) – You really shouldn't be in a situation where this applies, but it would be nice to have if you were.Hearing the Air (5th level Stance) – Blindsense out to 30 feet and a +5 bonus to Listen checks can help detect ambushes and pinpoint invisible creatures.Moment of Alacrity (6th level Boost) – Moving up in the initiative order never hurt anyone!Quicksilver Motion (7th level Boost) – Using a swift action to get a free move action is great for an archer.&amp;nbsp;Diamond Defense (8th level Counter) – The bonus to any save will be smaller than that of the lower level save boosting counters if you've leveled Concentration, but this could be taken as a backup.Stance of Alacrity (8th level Stance) – It certainly helps your action economy with counters.Time Stands Still (9th level Strike) – Yes, two full round attacks in one round is golden! And maybe combine it with Moment of Alacrity if anyone is left alive.Iron HeartWall of Blades (2nd level Counter) – This lets you make a melee attack roll to substitute for your AC against an enemy attack. It may look cool to bat an arrow out of the air with your gauntlet or block a sword with your elvencraft bow, but it's still not a great idea. That being said, it fulfills the prerequisites for other Iron Heart maneuvers.Iron Heart Surge (3rd level Counter) – Alright, now we're talking! This maneuver grants a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls until the start of your next turns. It also ends many negative status as a byproduct.Absolute Steel Stance (3rd level Stance) – This gives you a +2 Dodge bonus to AC if you move 10 or more feet in a round. There may be some synergy with skirmishing here. Iron Heart Focus (5th level Counter) – Worth taking if you don't have access to Diamond Mind, or are paranoid about saving throws.Iron Heart Endurance (6th level Boost) – Self-healing can save your bacon in a pinch, but isn't a primary concern for an archer.Setting SunCounter Charge (1st level Counter) – I suppose you could use this if being charged by the enemy is a concern. Mighty Throw (1st level Strike) – It can certainly be used to get an opponent off of you, but your team would have had to fail pretty badly for this to be an issue. This can go for all of the other throwing maneuvers. The higher you get, the less useful they are to an archer.Step of the Wind (1st level Stance) – Ignoring movement penalties can be handy. In addition, you get a +2 on attack rolls and a +4 bonus bull rush and trip attempts against enemies you attack who are standing on difficult terrain and suffer movement penalties.Baffling Defense (2nd level Counter) – You can take this if you have a good Sense Motive check. Changes are you won't.Ghostly Defense (8th level Stance) – You can cause enemy friendly fire this way, but it'd be best not to be surrounded by enemies in the first place.Shadow HandChild of Shadow (1st level Stance) – Concealment if you move 10 feet? Sounds good to me!Cloak of Deception (2nd level Boost) – Invisibility is also good.Shadow Jaunt (2nd level Maneuver) – Short ranged teleport is great for escaping dangerous situations or maneuvering into position for an ambush.Assassin's Stance (3rd level Stance) – A stance that grants +2d6 Sneak Attack? This keeps getting better and better.Dance of the Spider (3rd level Stance) – Being able to walk on walls keeps you away from the enemy.Shadow Garrote (3rd level Strike) – You can trigger Sneak Attack with this ranged touch attack, but it's not particularly useful.Shadow Stride (5th level Maneuver) – Shadow Jaunt as a move action. Step of the Dancing Moth (5th level Stance) – It allows you to hover and ignore difficult terrain and some traps, but more important is the ability to ignore the Hide and Move Silently penalties for moving quickly, which can help out with scouting.Shadow Noose (6th level Strike) – Much like Shadow Garrote.Shadow Blink (7th level Maneuver) – Teleportation as a swift action is a fantastic way to scoot and shoot.Balance on the Sky (8th level Stance) – You must have one hand free to use this Stance. Most archers need that hand.One with Shadow (8th level Counter) – You gain the incoporeal subtype, which is both a defensive and mobility option. The template description states that objects which leave an incoporeal creature's possession become coporeal, so you can shoot arrows without issue.Stone DragonThis school offers nothing of value.&amp;nbsp;Tiger ClawBlood in the Water (1st level Stance) – You likely won't be generating enough criticals to make use of this, but if you can somehow make it work, feel free to use this stance.Hunter's Sense (1st level Stance) – Scent can be a useful ability for scouting and detecting invisible enemies.Sudden Leap (1st level Boost) – It's a mobility option and costs a swift action, which means that with a high enough Jump check,&amp;nbsp; you could move and still shoot. You'll still incur an Attack of Opportunity, though.Leaping Dragon Stance (3rd level Stance) – It grants a +10 enhancement bonus to jump checks, and lets you make standing jumps as if you had a 20ft running start. This will let you jump around shooting people when combined with Sudden Leap.Dancing Mongoose (Level 5 Boost) – While the language used in this maneuver clearly intends for it to be used in two weapon combat, nowhere does it specify it must be done with melee weapons. Thus, an archer can use it to gain an additional attack at his highest BAB for each weapon he wields against an enemy he made an attack roll against in the round he initiated the boost.&amp;nbsp;Raging Mongoose (8th level Boost) – This functions exactly like Dancing Mongoose, except it gives you two attacks for each weapon you are wielding.&amp;nbsp;White RavenBolstering Voice (1st level Stance) – A bonus to will saves may be useful on occasion.Leading the Charge (1st level Stance) – Definitely not.Lion's Roar (3rd level Boost) – Gain a +5 damage bonus for one round after reducing an enemy to 0 HP or fewer. Damage boosts are always good for archers.White Raven Tactics (3rd level Boost) – This is a great teamwork maneuver, but not for archery. Still, it could offer a tactical advantage in general.Press the Advantage (5th level Stance) – Taking an extra 5ft step offers a decent amount of maneuverability. In fact, it's just enough to trigger Skirmish. You can also step out from behind cover, take a full attack, and step back behind cover.Order Forged from Chaos (6th level Maneuver) – Not relevant to archery, but may offer tactical benefits such as forming defensive lines against enemy attackers.Overall Tome of Battle offers melee potent options in terms of maneuverability, defenses, and action economy. Some of this is useful to the archer, especially multiclassed archers.FeatsShadow Trickster [ToB, Pg. 32] – Requires caster level 1, one Shadow Hand strikeWhen you are in a Shadow Hand stance, this feat boosts your save DCs for illusions by +2 and grants a +2 bonus on the damage rolls for Sneak Attack and Sudden Strike. The only downside is that you have to take a level in a spellcasting class. I'm sorry, did I say downside?Song of the White Raven [ToB, Pg. 32] – Requires Bardic Music (Inspire Courage, one White Raven maneuverWhen you are in a White Raven stance, you may activate Inspire Courage as a swift action and stack Bard and Crusader and Warblade levels for determining the bonus granted by Inspire Courage. See the Inspiring Archer section for more information on Inspire Courage.Incarnum Archers&amp;nbsp;It is not the arrow that is the weapon, but the archer.OverviewIncarnum is one of the underused subsystems that came out late in 3.5E's lifetime, which is a pity because it's rather fun. By allowing classes to essentially create their own magic items, it offered a variety of flexible and interesting options for non-spellcasters. And fortunately, some of those options apply to archery!Building an Incarnum Archer&amp;nbsp;Your meldshapng defines your capabilities, so we must take a close look at the soulmelds. There are two paths to take: using soulmelds to support bow based archery, or using soulmelds that grant ranged attacks. This guide will focus on the former.Soulmelds for ArcheryBluesteel Bracers – These grant a +2 bonus to initiative. In addition, they grant +1 to damage on weapon rolls per essentia invested. If bound to the arms, the bonuses are shared with allies within 30 feet.Lucky Dice – Swift action to use, requires a 2d6 dice roll to activate. If the roll totals 7, you gain&amp;nbsp; +1 to attack/damagerolls, saves, and ability/skill checks for 1 round, +1 round per essentia invested. Any other roll and you have to choose one of the three. If bound to your hands, you will share the bonuses with allies within 30 feet.Sighting Gloves – These grant a +1 insight bonus on ranged damage per point of essentia invested. If bound to the hands, they grant the benefits of the Precise Shot feat, though not the feat itself. If you will be taking Precise Shot to qualify for feats, you might as well bind the Lucky Dice to your hands.Fellmist Robe – Concealment vs ranged attacks 10% base, with an additional 5% per essentia invested. Binding it to the soul will apply the concealment to adjacent attackers as well.FeatsBonus Essentia [MoI, Pg. 35] – Requires Con 3, level 6More essentia is essential for Incarnum charatcters.Expanded Soulmeld Capacity [MoI, Pg. 38]Invest more, but invest wisely! Cobalt Precision [MoI, Pg. 37]&amp;nbsp; – Requires Point Blank Shot, Con 13The only Incarnum feat specifically for ranged characters is rather underwhelming since it only provides a bonus to rolls to confirm ranged criticals and the damage dealt.Midnight Augmentation [MoI, Pg. 38] – Requires Con 13, 2nd level powersGood for reducing power cost in a psionic build.Midnight Metamagic [MoI, Pg. 39] – Requires Con 13, ability to cast 1st level spells, any metamagic featA good choice if you plan on multiclassing into a spellcasting class. Persisting a spell could be quite valuable!Shape Soulmeld [MoI, Pg. 40] – Requires Con 13See a soulmeld you like on some other class's list? Now it's yours!Split Chakra [MoI, Pg. 41] – No prerequisitesNeed to have both magic items and a soulmeld? Not a problemFactotum ArchersOur arrows will blot out the sun.Overview It should come as no surprise that the jack of all trades class can do archery as well. Although Factotums are not a martial class, they've got a few tricks up their sleeves to keep themselves competitive. Building a Factotum ArcherThe key to the Factotum uses for his combat effectiveness are his cunning plans.&amp;nbsp;Cunning Insight allows him to add his Intelligence modifier as a competence bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, or saving throws.Cunning Knowledge provides a bonus to Knowledge checks, which plays well with Knowledge Devotion.Cunning Strike gives +1d6 Sneak Attack damage.Cunning Surge grants an extra standard action which can be used for Manyshot.Cunning Brilliance lets him to emulate 3 class abilities available to a standard character at level 15 or lower.And let us not forget about their formidable linguistic capabilities! The Factotum is as cunning as a fox who has been appointed professor of Cunning at Oxford University!The Factotum runs all these abilities off of Inspiration Points, so he must manage them wisely if he wishes to be an effective archer. These abilities are complimented by his extensive skill list and ability to cast a small selection of spells. (See the Arcane Archer, Divine Archer, Divine Archer, and Shapeshift Archer sections for some good spells to choose.)FeatsFont of Inspiration [WotC Web Enhancement] – Int 15, must have Inspiration as a class featureThis is the fuel for your Factotum's fire. You gain 1 inspiration point for taking this feat the first time, and you gain 1 extra inspiration point on top of that each time you take it again. Taking it twice, for instance, yields 2 inspiration points the second time on top of the 1 you got the first time.Prestige ClassesChameleon [RoD, Pg. 111]Requirements:Race: Human or Doppelganger (or Changeling if in Eberron)Skills: Bluff 8 ranks , Disguise 8 ranks , Sense Motive 4 ranks Spellcraft 4 ranksFeats: Able Learner (if human)The versatile prestige class for the versatile archer! The main attraction of the Chamelon is the fact that it grants stat bonuses, arcane and divine spellcasting, the ability to emulate class features including Smite and Sneak Attack, and a floating bonus feat Divine Archers&amp;nbsp;Deus VultOverviewAh, the Divine Archer. While it does suffer from a touch of Multiple Attribute Dependency, it is quite viable with enough support. Between domains with archery-related benefits, buffing spells, metamagic, and divine feats, a priest can smite people as hard as Zeus himself!Building a Divine Archer The Quickstart Cleric Archer Handbook covers the basics very well. You're going to have to be careful of your race selection, as it affects your stats, feats, and what deities you can worship.It is noted that there are very few deities which both grant the War domain and have a longbow as their favored weapon. Fortunately, if your DM is open to using the Greek Pantheon, you can worship Athena, as she was historically the goddess of wisdom and military victory, known for her skill with the Bow and Arrow. This is reflected in her Deities and Demigods domains, which are Artifice, Community, Good, Knowledge, Law, and War.&amp;nbsp;A regular Cleric can get the War domain and the Law domain to trade in for Law Devotion, while a Cloistered Cleric can trade in his additional Knowledge domain for Knowledge Devotion.Archivists [HoH] make an interesting choice for Divine Archers as well. Thir Dark Knowledge class feature compliments Knowldge Devotion, and the can cherrypick spells from all Divine spell lists, such as Hunter's Eye.Paladins can be built as archers, perhaps even as mounted archers to take advantage of the Paladin mount, but they do not have an easy way to obtain the feats necessary for ranged combat, nor do the rest of their class features or spells support it. That being said, on page 204 of the DMG,&amp;nbsp; the last bullet point under the &quot;Unusual Mounts&quot; section states that a Paladin can get a gold dragon as a mount. This is awesome and makes more sense than wielding a lance while riding a dragon.The Spirit Shaman and Favored Soul can both be built as Archers, but neither have access to the bonus feats, turning feats, or metamagic tricks found in this section. The Favored Soul can use the Cleric's spells, while the Spirit Shaman should consult the Shapeshift Archer section for spell suggestions. Cleric Spells Level 1Divine Favor [SRD] – Luck bonus of&amp;nbsp;+ to attack and damage per 3 caster levels, max +3.Blessed Aim [SpC] –Grants you and allies a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls.Guiding Light [SpC] – +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls for enemies illuminated by the light.Ice Slick [SpC] – Divine version of the Grease spell, which creates a 20 foot radius ice slick which enemies must balance on.Snow Shoes [SpC] – Provides a +10 foot enhancement bonus to movement speed, eliminates the need to make a Balance check or Reflex save to walk on ice and snow without slipping and falling, to avoid cracking ice, or to avoid falling through cracked ice, and eliminates trails on ice. Slip these on and kick some ice!Level 2Owl's Wisdom [SRD] – More Wisdom is good, especially with Zen ArcherySpiritual Weapon [SRD] – A spiritual weapon that moves around and attacks people is handy for increasing your total damage output and keeping enemies away.Align Weapon [SRD] – Bypassing Damage Reduction is a great thing to have in your back pocket.Cloud of Knives [SpC] – You get one free attack per round at targets within 30 feet of you. This normally lasts for 1 round per caster level, but can be persisted.Divine Insight [SpC] – This spell is discharged to grant a 5&amp;nbsp;+ caster level (max +15) insight bonus to a single skill check. Duration of 1 hour per caster level. Good when paired with Knowledge Devotion.Guidance of the Avatar [WotC Web Enhancement] – This grants a +20 bonus to a single skill check, but it must be used within one minute.Level 3Dispel Magic [SRD] – Handy if someone puts up a Wind Wall.&amp;nbsp;Ghost Touch Weapon [SpC] – Don't be afraid of no ghost.Girallon's Blessing [SpC] – This grants an extra pair of arms and claw attacks to go with them.Level 4Divine Power [SRD]&amp;nbsp;– You need the power: Divine Power! It increases your BAB to your character level, granting extra attacks, gives a +6 enhancement bonus to Strength, and provides 1 hit point per caster level. You got the power!Greater Magic Weapon [SRD] – Makes room on your weapon for more special abilities!Freedom of Movement [SRD] – This ensures that you are free of crowd control.Recitation [SpC] – Allies gain a +2 luck bonus to AC, attack rolls, and saving throws, +3 if they worship the same deity as the caster.&amp;nbsp; Level 5Righteous Might [SRD] – Increases your size and strength, with corresponding improvements to your damage.Divine Agility [SpC] – If you're not using Zen Archery, you should use this to gain a +10 enhancement bonus to agility! The short duration means you'll have to Persist it to get any use out of it.Draconic Polymorph [SpC] – Allows you to assume a form with HD equal to your caster level, capped at 20 HD. This lets you become an arrow demon.Surge of Fortune [CC] – Grants a a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and spell penetration checks, as well as to Armor Class. Can be discharged to grant a 20 on your next attack roll, saving throw, skill check, ability check, or spell penetration check.True Seeing [SRD] – Expensive, but it negates illusions.&amp;nbsp; Wall of Stone [SRD] – Not only is it a barrier, you can use it to construct fortifications!&amp;nbsp;Level 6Dispel Magic, Greater [SRD] – For when regular Dispel Magic becomes obsolete.Hero's Feast [SRD] – Breakfast of champions, grants useful bonuses. Visage of the Deity [SpC] – Grants a smite attempt, in addition to a few other bonuses.Level 7Holy Transformation [SpC] – Turns you into a hound archon, granting numerous bonuses.&amp;nbsp;Level 8Symbol of Insanity [SRD] – Put these on your arrows. [Relevant OotS]Level 9Greater Visage of the Deity [SpC] – Grants a multitude of useful bonuses and abilities. FeatsDivine Metamagic [CD, Pg. 80] – Requires the ability to Turn or Rebuke UndeadThis lets you use turning attempts to pay for the level adjustment of a metamagic feat. Choose Persist Spell and enjoy your favorite buffs all day long!Extend Spell (+1 level) [SRD]Doubles the duration of spells you cast for a +1 level adjustment. Good for buffing.Persistent Spell (+6 level) [CA, Pg. 81] – Requires Extend SpellIncrease the duration of a spell with a fixed or personal range to 24 hours. Good, but requires metamatic reduction. This is a three feat investment at minimum, but the benefits are immense.Battle Blessing [CC, Pg. 55] – Requires paladin spellcastingThis improves the casting time of paladin spells by one category. Divine Might [CW, Pg. 106] – Requires Power Attack, Turn or Rebuke Undead.Spend a turn undead attempt to add your Charisma modifer to your weapon damage for one round. Could be useful if you had high Charisma.Holy Warrior [CC, Pg. 60] – Requries the ability to cast 4th level spells, access to the War domainThis is a reserve feat that allows you to gain a bonus to weapon damage equal to the level of the highest War domain spell you have not cast. War domain spells are often underwhelming, so no loss there!It also grants +1 caster level to Force spells, which may be helpful on occasion.Law Devotion [CC, Pg. 61] – No requirementsYou are the law! This feat grants you a +3 bonus to attack rolls or armor class for one minute, which you can reallocate at the beginning of your turn. The bonus increases to +5 at 10th level, and +7 at 5th level. Extra uses of this feat cost 3 turn attempts each.ItemsNightstick (7500 gp) [LM]This grants you 4 extra Turn Undead attempts. Buy a few.Arcane ArchersA good archer is not known by his arrows, but by his aim.OverviewCombining magic talent with martial skill has been an archetype as old as D&amp;amp;D itself. A ranged attack strategy works well with the arcanist's ranged spells and lack of hit points; moreover, you get to take direct advantage of buffing spells. Most spells are a standard action to cast and can't be used in conjunction with archery, but swift action spells can be used to compliment your archery.Building an Arcane ArcherThey key thing to decide on is whether you want to be a spellcaster who plinks at the enemies or an archer who uses magic to enhance his archery. Given how feat intensive archery is, the latter route is preferable.Class choice is critical. For example, Sorcerers get more spells per day, but require Charisma to cast spells, which is yet another stat to sink points into. The Wizard, on the other hand, casts off Intelligence which synergizes with Knowledge Devotion. And a Focused Specialist can get almost as many spells as a sorcerer!The Duskblade is geared towards melee combat, but it can work for ranged combat as well, especially since it is Intelligence based like the wizard. There's a nice, simple option for arcane archers, though you may have to poach the occasional spell from the Sorcerer/Wizard spell list.Sorcerer/Wizard SpellsLevel 1Arrow Mind [SpC] – Immediate action. This spell lets you threaten squares within their normal melee reach and avoid provoking Attacks of Opportunity when shooting.Blade of Blood Blade of Blood [SpC] – Swift action. Deal 1d6 extra damage, or take 5 points of damage to deal +2d6 extra damage. Adds up really fast with volleys!Blockade [CS] – Swift action. Forms a 5 ft. wooden cube in front of you. It also floats!Deflect, Lesser [SpC] – Swift action. Gain a deflection bonus of +1/3 caster levels against one attack.Expeditious Retreat [SRD] – Faster movement does help with strafing enemies.Grease [SRD] – It renders enemies prone and flat-footed if they balance on it without 5 ranks in BalanceGuided Shot [SpC] – Swift action. This spell lets you ignore range penalties due to distance and the AC bonus of any cover shot of total cover, and the miss chance granted by concealment less than total concealment.&amp;nbsp; Mount [SRD] – Serves as a steed, and can also be a portable meatshield.Reduce Person [SRD] – Grants a bonus to Dexterity and to attack rolls! The Strength penalty might be an issue for your bow, though.Targeting Ray [SpC] – Ranged touch attack gives you and your allies a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls/3 caster levels for the duration of the spell.&amp;nbsp; True Strike [SRD] – A great way to hit difficult targets and enemies in concealment! But it is a standard action to cast and only applies to one attack.Level 2Alter Self [SRD] – Grants you access to new forms, which is generally useful. You can become a troglodyte if you wnat more natural armor and a hide bonus, a Bugbear for a bonus to move silently, etc. The real power for an archer, however, is in winged humanoid forms such as the Avariel or the Raptoran.Cat's Grace [SRD] – Extra Dexterity helps you hit enemies.Deflect [SpC] – Swift. Grants a shield bonus of +1/2 caster levels against one attack.Energy Surge, Lesser [PHBII] – Swift action. Adds +1d6 acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic energy damage to a weapon. Fly, Swift [SPC] – Swift Action. Lets you fly for 1 round. Probably better for mobility than Levitate.Glitterdust [SRD] – Blinds creatures, outlines invisible creatures. Heroics [SpC] – Grants an extra feat from the Figher bonus list.Invisiblity [SRD] – Allows you to position yourself and attack enemies while they are unawares.Invisibility, Swift [SpC] – Swift action. A dedicated archer may get more use out of this, since you don't care about the duration and want to focus on your action economy.Levitate [SRD] – Keeps you away from the enemy, but lacks mobility.See Invisibility [SRD] – You have to see the enemy if you want to hit them.Sonic Weapon [SpC] – Weapon deals 1d6 Sonic damage. Spider Climb [SRD] – This lets you move around over all sorts of terrain.Sure Strike [SpC] –Grants an insight bonus of +1/3 caster levels to your next attack roll.Level 3Crown of Protection [SpC] – Gain a +1 deflection bonus to AC and a +1 resistance bonus to saves. Discharge as an immediate action to gain a +4 bonus to AC or saves for 1 round.Blink [SRD] – Grants numerous defensive and mobility options, and allows you to attack enemies as if you were invisible! Dispel Magic [SRD] – Handy if someone puts up a Wind Wall. Note: Level 4 for Duskblades.Displacement [SRD] – Grants total concealment, but has a short duration. Energy Surge [PHBII] – Swift action. +2d6 of your chosen energy type in damage this time.Explosive Runes [SRD] – If this is triggered by the arrow breaking, or if the DM rules that enemies will read runes on the arrow shaft, you should definitely apply these to your arrows.Fire Arrow [SRD] – A pittance of fire damage is not worth it.Haste [SRD] – Bonus to attack rolls, movement speed, and an extra attack at your highest BAB on a full attack? Yes!Heroism [SRD] – A +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks.Magic Weapon, Greater [SRD] – Both increases attack and damage and saves room for special enchantments!Phantom Steed [SRD] – A great upgrade from the Mount spell, and it can even fly at higher levels!Shrink Item [SRD] – The (ab)uses for this spell are endless, but it depends on your DM's interpretation of conservation of momentum.Tiny Hut [SRD] – This is not intended to be a combat spell, but it can be used as a portable pillbox since the hut is opaque when viewed from the outside (granting occupants total concealment), but transparent from within.&amp;nbsp;Wings of Cover [RotC] – This is a sorcerer only spell worth mentioning because it grants total cover against one attack as an immediate action.Level 4Dimension Door [SRD] – Great tactical teleportation spell for ranged characters.Invisibility, Greater [SRD] – Now you no longer lose invisibility for attacking!Ruin Delver's Fortune [SpC] – Immediate action. Mentioned because it grants a luck bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to fortitude, reflex, or will saves (your choice.). If you need temporary hit points, it grants 4d8+Charisma modifier temporary hit points. Sturdy Cottage [SRD] – You can use this as an impromptu fortification.Shadow Conjuration [SRD] – Shadow Conjuration offers you access to many versatile spells. In addition, since you know it's an illusion, you can see through a Shadow Fog Cloud while the enemy would have to succeed on their will save to realize it is an illusion, if they get to interact with it at all.Polymorph [SRD] – You can turn into many useful forms with this, but there aren't many that are helpful to archers per-se. Thri-Keen are good for the stat bonuses, extra arms, and the Deflect Arrows racial bonus feat. If you have the Outsider subtype, in which case you want to be an Arrow Demon [MMIII].Level 5Dimension Jumper [CM] – Swift action. Teleport up to 30 feet per round as a move action for the spell durationGreater Blink [SpC] – Controlled blinking back and forth! You can now cast spells while blinking and they will land on target! Sonic Shield [SpC] – This grants a +4 deflection bonus to AC and both damages and pushes away people who attack you in melee.Level 6Dispel Magic, Greater [SRD] – For when regular Dispel Magic becomes obsolete.Symbol of Fear [SRD] – You can put it n your arrows. It's a pity that many enemies are immune to fear.Tenser's Transformation [SRD] – IT'S A TRAP!True Seeing [SRD] – Expensive, but it negates illusions. Level 7Ethereal Jaunt [SRD] – It lets you attack ethereal creatures if you don't have a Ghost Touch weapon. You should, so this is only useful for defense and mobility.Level 8Moment of Prescience [SRD] – Gain an insight bonus equal to your caster level (max +25) on one attack roll, opposed ability or skill check, or save.Superior Invisibility [SpC] – Not only are you invisible, you are pretty much immune to detection spells aside from True Seeing!Level 9Shapechange [SRD] – Turn into differnt forms for fun and profit! The Arrow Demon is good, but the Chronotyryn [FF] is better. Two rounds worth of actions is nothing to sneeze at! If that's not an option, you can always go for the Choker [SRD], who gets an extra move or standard action each round.Time Stop [SRD] – Not that useful for an archer, but you can use the time to prepare for combat.FeatsArcane Strike [CW, Pg. 96] – BAB +4, ability to cast 3rd level Arcane spells.You sacrifice a spellslot to gain a bonus on all your attack rolls for 1 round equal to the level of the spell sacrificed, as well as extra damage equal to 1d4 points x the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus you add to your attack rolls is limted by your BAB, but the damage is not capped.Practiced Spellcaster [CD, Pg. 82] – Requires 4 ranks in Spellcraft.This helps make up for caster levels lost to multiclassing or prestige classes.Smiting Spell (+1 level) [PHBII] – Requires BAB +1, caster level 1stYou can transfer a touch spell into melee weapon or ammuniton. It discharges when it strikes the enemy, but must be used within 1 minute of being cast or else it dissipates.Prestige ClassesArcane Archer [SRD]Requirements:Base Attack Bonus: +6Race: Elf (or) or Half-ElfFeats: Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Weapon Focus (longbow or shortbow)Spells: Ability to cast 1st level arcane spells. This is the one everyone thinks of. The Arcane Archer. How does it do? Not that great. Its is geared towards martial characters who are light on the spellcasting; it grants full BAB, but does not offer spellcasting progression. Furthermore, you have to be an elf or half-elf. Elves generally get a penalty to Constitution, and the races that don't get penalties to Strength or Intelligence, all of which you may need.The abilities are:Enhance Arrow – Grants a +1 enhancement bonus to the Arcane Archer's arrows, with an additional +1 for ever 2 levels above 1st.Imbue Arrow – This is what most people are interested in when they take this class. The second level ability lets you put an Area of Effect spells in the arrow that is then centered where the arrow lands, even if the spell would normally be centered on yourself, such as Antimagic Field.Seeker Arrow – At 4th level, you may launch an arrow that seeks out a known target within its range as long as there is no unavoidable obstacle. It is limited by the fact that you may only do this once per day.Phase Arrow – At 6th level, you can shoot an arrow that goes through nonmagical barriers. Once per day, again.Hail of Arrows – At 8th level, you can give up your regular attacks to launch one arrow at each enemy within range, capped by your Arcane Archer level. This is worse than using your full attack. Once per day, thank God. Arrow of Death – At 10th level, you can launch an Arrow of Death at an enemy which forces a DC 20 Fortitude save against ddeath. This arrow takes one day to craft, lasts for one year, and you cannot have more than on eat a time. This is extra useless.Judgement: This is only really worth taking up to level 2.Eldritch Knight [SRD]Requirements:Proficiency with all martial weaponsMust be able to cast 3rd level Arcane spellsThis class grants Full BAB and 9/10th spellcasting progression. The first level does not grant casting, but does give a Fighter bonus feat. It's fine as a filler, but rather boring.Knight Phantom [FN]Requirements:Skills: Ride 4 ranksFeats: Still SpellProficiency in all martial weapons.Ability to cast phantom steed.Special: Citizen of Aundair, member of the Order of the Knights Arcane.The Knight Phantom is a full BAB, 9/10th casting class much like the Eldritch Knight. Instead of a bonus feat, it grants:Phantom Steed – A 1st level Knight Phantom can summon a Phantom Steed a number of times per day equal to his Knight Phantom level. His levels of Knight Phantom stack with those of his highest arcane spellcasting class for determining the caster level.Somatic Prowess – A 1st level Knight Phantom learns to cast spells in light armor. Handy.Aspect of the Phantom – At 4th level, a Knight Phantom gets to hover above the ground and walk on water a number of rounds equal to his Knight Phantom levels.Countenance of the Phantom – At 7th level, a Knight Phantom gains concealment with a 20% miss chance for a number of rounds equal&amp;nbsp; to his Knight Phantom level. He can also cause each creature within 10 feet of him to become shaken unless they pass a will save, but the DC is 10 + his class level + his Charisma modifier, and enemies will likely be immune to fear effects at that level anyways.Blade of the Phantom – At 10th level, a Knight Phantom can give a melee weapon the Brilliant Energy property for a number of rounds per day equal to his Knight Phantom level.Judgement: Good at first level. There's nothing wrong with continuing on to progress BAB and spellcasting if you have nothing better to do, but it's not great either.Inspiring ArchersAt one hundred yards, volley fire present! Aim! FIRE!-Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, Zulu (1964)OverviewThe primary focus of this guide is on building an archer character, but many of the spells used by Divine and Arcane Archers apply to the rest of the party. What if we build an archer whose emphasis was on supporting the rest of the party while they fight?Building an Inspiring ArcherAs far as support classes go, the one most suited for an Inspiring Archer is the Bard due to Inspire Courage, which can provide substantial bonuses to attack and damge rolls. The Bard only gets shortbow proficiency, so he will have to either multiclass or spend a feat to access a better weapon.Fortunately, the Marshal [MinH] is a martial support class that is proficient with all martial weapons, grants the useful Skill Focus: Diplomacy feat, and a minor aura which applies a circumstance bonus equal to the Marshal's Charisma bonus to various checks and rollls. A popular choice is the Motivate Dexterity Aura for a bonus to Dexterity checks, Dexterity based skill checks, and initiative checks. Not only does the Marshal's supurb leadership and impeccable orders result in his team going first in combat, but he can even make his teammates more stealthy by yelling at them!&amp;nbsp;This pairs well with the Bard's Mimicking Song ACF [DS] which replaces the Inspire Competence bonus with a +2 bonus to Move Silently checks for all allies within 30 feet. Your team can literally sing and dance their way into an enemy stronghold to conduct ambushes. But more on that elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;The next level gets you a Major Aura, one of which grants a +1 bonus to ranged attack rolls, and a third level grants you another Minor Aura. You could select Motivate Intelligence to gain a bonus to Knowledge Devotion checks, or Motivate Charisma for social fun, but you've lost out on two levels of Bard spellcasting, Bardic Music, and skill points.&amp;nbsp; This is probably as far as you want to go as a Marshal, and that's only if you really, really want that second aura.Bard SpellsLevel 1Grease [SRD] – It renders enemies prone and flat-footed if they balance on it without 5 ranks in balance.Focusing Chant [SpC] – Grants a +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 minute.Improvisation [SpC] – You gain a floating pool of luck points which can be used to improve attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. Works well with Knowledge Devotion.Inspirational Boost [SpC] – Swift action. Increases the bonus of your Inspire Courage by 1.Targeting Ray [SpC] – Ranged touch attack gives you and your allies a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls/3 caster levels for the duration of the spell. Level 2Alter Self [SRD] – Like the Arcane Archer, you can get a great deal of mileage out of this. Perhaps more, since you will have social skills.Glitterdust [SRD] – You need to have a way to detect invisible opponents since your don't get See Invisibility until later. The debuff is also nice.Invisibility [SRD] – You have the skills for sneaking, making this a great choice.Pyrotechnics [SRD] – Notable because it is a long range spell. You can blind a small army with this and then pepper them from a distance while they are helpless to return fire.Fly, Swift [SpC] – Lets you fly for 1 round. Probably better for mobility than Levitate.Sonic Weapon [SpC] – Weapon deals 1d6 Sonic damage. Level 3Blink [SRD] – Grants numerous defensive and mobility options, and allows you to attack enemies as if you were invisible! Dispel Magic [SRD] – Handy if someone puts up a Wind Wall.Displacement [SRD] – Grants total concealment, but has a short duration.G'Elsewhere Chant [SpC] – Useful for getting out of a spot in a hurry, but you wind up in a random safe location 100 feet away. Haste [SRD] – Bonus to attack rolls, movement speed, and an extra attack at your highest BAB on a full attack.&amp;nbsp;See Invisibility [SRD] – You have to see the enemy if you want to hit them.Tiny Hut [SRD] – You can't afford to spend one of your few spells known on this.Level 4Dimension Door [SRD] – This is still good, but you are tight on spell slots so be careful.Freedom of Movement [SRD] – It makes sure you're free to move around and shoot people.Ruin Delver's Fortune [SpC] – Immediate action. Mentioned because it grants a luck bonus equal to your Charisma modifier to fortitude, reflex, or will saves (your choice.). If you need temporary hit points, it grants 4d8+Charisma modifier temporary hit points.Shadow Conjuration [SRD] – The versatility of this spell will make up for your limited spell list.Siren's Grace [SpC] – You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, add your Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to armor class, and gain a +8 bonus to perform checks, in addition to a swim speed, the ability to breathe underwater, and make attacks normally under water. Useful in general and incredible in an aquatic environment.Level 5Dimension Jumper [CM] – Swift action. Teleport up to 30 feet per round as a move action for the spell duration. Level 6Dispel Magic, Greater [SRD] – Dispelling is always nice.Hero's Feast [SRD] – It's not bad, but you grant bigger bonuses to attack and saves against fear with your Bardic Music.FeatsDragonfire Inspiration [DM,Pg. 17] – Requires Cha 11, Bardic Music, dragonblood subtypeIn addition to Inspire Courage, you can imbue your alliees with Dragonfire. They gain 1d6 points of fire damage for every point of your Inspire Courage bonus. If you are dragonblooded, the energy type of your draconic heritage will determine the energy damage. This stacks with Inspire Courage.Leadership [SRD] – Requires character level 6thThis is good for all classes, but you have the Charisma to make it truly shine! Get yourself a sidekick, grab a bunch of minions, buff them to the gills, and have them volley your enemies to death.Martial Study [ToB, Pg. 31] – No prerequisitesYou gain a maneuver which you can use once per encounter. This is a great candiate for the Heroics spell.Martial Stance [ToB, Pg. 31] – Requires one maneuverYou could use this to snag Lion's Roar or Assassin's stance. Another candidate for Heroics.Melodic Casting [CM, Pg. 44] – Requires Perform 4 ranks, Spellcraft 4 ranks, Bardic Music class featureThis lets you substitute a Perform check for a Concentration check when casting spells. It also allows you to maintain your bard song while casting spells and activating command word and spell completion items.Song of the Heart [ECS, Pg. 60] – Perform 6 ranks, Bardic Music class feature, inspire competence abilityThis increases the bonus granted by your Bardic Music by +1.Words of Creation [BoED, Pg. 48] – Requires Int 15, Cha 15, base Will save bonus +5This allows you to use the Words of Creation, which offer many bonuses. For Bardic Music specifically, it doubles the bonuses granted by your songs. Ask your DM what the order of operation is if you have Words of Creation and other&amp;nbsp; means of boosting bardic music.ItemsBadge of Valor (1400 gp) [MiC, Pg. 207]Activating the Badge of Valor is an immediate action. It grants you and your allies a +2 bonus on the next save vs charm or fear effects. If Inspire Courage is active, it boosts the bonus by +1. This item functions 3 times per day.Lute-Bow (250 gp) [City]Your lute now serves as a shortbow. Stylish and functional!Psionic Archers&amp;nbsp;The arrow is an extension of the self.OverviewPsionic archers, much like Divine and Arcane Archers, use psionics to augment their archery, reduce the cost of their powers, and manipulate the action economy. Building a Psionic ArcherThere are three classes suitable as a base for Psionic Archers.The first is the Psychic Warrior. Not only does it gain bonus feats, The Mind's Eye Web Enhancement granted it two alternative class features:Mantled Warrior: Loses the Psychic Warrior's 2nd level bonus feat in exchange for learning one of the Ardent's mantles and gaining the mantle ability. The mantles most suitable for archery are:&amp;nbsp;Freedom for the&amp;nbsp;+10 ft bonus to movement speed when psionically focused and access toof mobility powersKnowledge for the ability to discharge your psionic focus for a&amp;nbsp;+5 to Knowledge checks.Might for the bonus power points.Time for the +2 bonus to initiative and access to Anticipatory Strike, which allows you to take a turn as an immediate action.Soulbound Weapon: Trades the 2nd level bonus feat for the the ability to call a Soulbound Weapon and the Weapon Focus feat for that weapon.Your first level power must be Call Weaponry.&amp;nbsp;From now on, you may use the Call Weaponry power to summon your Soulbound Weapon, which gains a +1 enhancement bonus for every 4 manifester levels you possess.&amp;nbsp;In addition, you may augment Call Weaponry: for each additional 5 power points you spend, you may add a weapon enhancement of +1 value to the weapon. This offers a great amount of flexibility in your choice of weapon enhancements.The second is the Ardent. It is a very flexible class with a rotating selection of mantles, and The Mind's Eye gave it two great alternative class features as well.Dominant Ideal causes you to lose the mantle you get at 10th level. In return, you pick a mantle whose powers you can apply metapsionic feats to without expending your focus, and it reduces the cost of applying metapsionic feats by 2.The Time mantle would be great for this. Your other mantle should be the Freedom mantle for mobility. Conflict is probably not worth it.Substitute Power allows you to customize an existing mantle by substituting its powers with alternative powers which must share a similar theme. This requires DM approval, so results may vary. The third is the Soulknife. The Mind's Eye gives it two excellent alternative class features:Hidden Talent straight up replaces Wild Talent, and is better since it grants a 1st level power and power points.Bonus Feats is completely uninspired as far as naming goes, but replaces Psychic Strike with bonus feats, which must be either feats designed for soulknifes or ones that the Mind Blade could benefit from.These make the Soulknife better, but it remains a melee focused class until the Soulbow prestige class is used – but more on that later. Psychic Warrior PowersLevel 1Call Weaponry [SRD] – Good spell for summoning weapons. Essential for the Soulbound Warrior.Metaphysical Weapon [SRD] – Grants enhancement bonuses to weapons.Precognition, Offensive [SRD] – A +1 bonus to attack rolls. Short duration. Does not augment well.Prescience, Offensive [SRD] – A +2 bonus to damage rolls. Short duration. Does not augment well.Level 2Concealing Amorpha [SRD] – Grants you 20% concealment.Detect Hostile Intent [SRD] – This prevents you from being surprised or caught flat-footed, allows you to detect hostile creatures within 30 feet of you, and lets you make Sense Motive checks as a free actin against those close to you.Dissolving Weapon [SRD] – Instant duration until weapon is used to attack someone.Hustle [SRD] – Swift action. Gain a move action. Scoot and shoot!Perfect Archery [CP] – Swift action. You can fire a bow without provoking Attacks of Opportunity.Strength of My Enemy [SRD] – Buff yourself, debuff the enemy. But you need a bow that automatically adjusts for strength to gain the full benefits of this power.Wall Walker [SRD] – Could be useful for maneuvering.Level 3Concealing Amorpha, Greater [SRD] – Total concealment greatly improves your survivability.Dimension Slide [SRD] – Teleport a short distance.Mental Barrier [SRD]&amp;nbsp; – I have trouble imagining why you would take this if Rings of Deflection exist.Vampiric Blade [SRD] – Hurt others and heal yourself!Level 4Dimension Door, Psionic [SRD] – The psionic versin of Dimension Door can be augmented to cast as a move action, which combines well with Hustle. The Complete Psionic version offers additional augmentation options.Freedom of Movement, Psionic [SRD] – Freedom of Movement lets you Hustle until you run out of powerpoints.Steadfast Perception [SRD] – Not only do you see through figments and illusions, you also get a +6 enhancement bonus to Spot and Search checks.Truevenom Weapon [SRD] – Swift action. Coats your weapon in poison.Weapon of Energy [SRD] – This is very disappointing.Level 5Change Fate [WotC Web Enhancement] – Could save you in an emergency, but costs 500 XP.Empower Weapon [CP] – Store a power in a weapon? Sure, why not.Level 6Mind Blank, Personal [SRD] – Now you will be immune to illusions and enchantments!FeatsExpanded Knowledge [SRD] – Requires manifester level 3rdYou gain a single power one level lower than the highest level you can manifest, even one from another class or discipline. Good candidates are:Anticipatory Strike [CP] – Actin economy shenanigans are always good.Dimension Hop [CP]Fly, Psionic [SRD]Metamorphosis [SRD] – Psionic Polymorph, good for the same reasons as regular Polymorph. Try the Thri-Keen for the stat bonuses, extra arms, and the Deflect Arrows racial bonus feat.Psychic Reformation [SRD] – This lets you redo skill point allocations, feat choices, and powers known, which grants you a substantial amount of flexibility. It costs 50 XP for each character level you choose to reform, so use it sparingly.Schism [SRD] – You get to take an additional standard action every round for mental actions, such as manifesting. Manifesting Psychic Reformation after Schism enables you to tailor your build on the fly. In additon, you may also feel like a Psionic Catholic Church.Psicrystal Affinity [SRD] – Requires manifester level 1stThis enables you to gain a Psicrystal, which is like a familiar in many ways. Psicrystal Containment [SRD] – Requires manifester level 3rdYou may psionically focus your psicrystal as a full round action, which means you double your number of focuses.Psionic Shot [SRD] – Requires Point Blank ShotExpend your Psionic Focus to deal +2d6 damage on your ranged attack.Greater Psionic Shot [SRD] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Psinic Shot, BAB +5You ranged attack now deals +4d6 damage when you expend your Psionic Focus.Fell Shot [SRD] – Requires Dex 13, Point Blank Shot, Psionic Shot, BAB +5. You can expend your Psionic Focus to resolve a ranged attack as a touch attack.Return Shot [SRD] – Requires Point Blank Shot, Psionic Shot, Fell Shot, BAB +3You must expend your Psionic Focus to negate one ranged attack and send it back at the attacker with the same attack bonuses. This only works if you are aware of the attack and not flat-footed.Prestige ClassesSlayer [SRD]Requirements:BAB +4Skills: Knowledge (Dungeoneering) 4 ranksFeats: TrackThis turns you into an Ranger, with extra bonuses against a type of Psionic creature of your choice.. Not terribly useful outside of that.Soulbow [CP]Requirements:Skills: Autohypnosis 8 ranks.Feats: Point Blank Shot.Special: Throw mind blade class feature.This prestige class redeems the Soulknife completely by giving it combat abilities that are both viable and awesome:Bonus feats – You get one at odd levels, which must come from a list of archery related feats. The prestige class explicitly notes that DMs should expand the list based on the material available in the game.Mind Arrows – These are basically a new shape for your Mind Blade, except that they behave as if they were shot out of a composite longbow. The damage is based on your Wisdom modifier. With Zen Archery, both attack and damage key off of Wisdom!Mind Arrow Enhancements – Not only do you get enhancement bonuses, you can also get weapon properties, including the Lucky property which is not normally found on ranged weapons! Enyour your free reroll with every attack! Do ya' feel lucky, punk? Well do ya'?Close Combat Shot – You can shoot people without incurring attacks of opportunity.Phase Arrow – This one's pretty bad, but it has no cap on uses, so it's still better than the Arcane Archer's version.As a bonus, you can also wield a shield for extra protection. This prestige class offers everything an archer could want. Since there's no need to go all in with Soulknife levels, I recommend dipping two levels into Ranger for Rapid Shot.Shapechaning ArchersTake your strinking paws off of me!OverviewThe ability to shapeshift into various forms offers characters a grat deal of versatility, but this applies more to melee combat than to archery. Most bows to not automatically adjust for changing strength, and most forms do not offer special bonuses for archery – if, indeed, they have the opposible thumbs needed for wielding bows and arrows in the first place. Building a Shapeshift ArcherThe Wild Shape Ranger [SRD] trades in his Combat Style for Wild Shape for small and medium animals. The Baboon is the most likely to be able to use a bow without the DM objecting, but this doesn't offer much improvement over a regular archer outside of its climb speed. The Master of Many Forms prestige class opens up more options for Wild Shape forms such as giants, monstrous humanoids, fety, etc, though none of them seem particularly suited for archery.The Druid is in the same boat as the Wild Shape Ranger, except he has less BAB and more spellcasting. While the Druid does have many battlefield control spells, making a battlefield control druid is beyond the scope of this guide. Offhand, I can recommend the Obscuring Snow. [Frost] and Snowsight [Frost] spells.Both classes get Animal Companions, which opens up the possibility of Mounted Combat. But at that point, you're probably not shapeshifting.SpellsThere aren't many good spells for the archer Druid in core.Faerie Fire (1st) outlines enemies and negates concealment.&amp;nbsp;Longstrider (1st) lets you move faster.&amp;nbsp;Shapechange (1st) lets you exploit the same forms as the Arcane Archer.Druids get some more archery support outside of core, though.Hawkeye [SpC] – 1st level spell. increases the range increment for ranged weapons you wield by 50%, and grants&amp;nbsp; +5 competence bonus on Spot checks.Snowshoes [SpC] – Handy for the movement bonus and ability to avoid ice hazards. Strictly superior to Longstrider. Master Air [SpC] – 2ndl evel spell. Allows you to fly at decent speed with good maneuverability, but it doesn't last long.Fly, Swift [SpC] – 3rd level. Druids get this too.Owl's Insight [SpC] – 5th level. Subject gains enhancement bonus to Wisdom equal to half your caster level. Works well with Zen Archery.Siren's Grace [SpC] – 5th level. Druids don't benefit from the Charisma boost or Charisma to AC, but it still lets them swim, breathe in water, and use ranged weapons underwater.Wind Tunnel [SpC] – 5th level. Grants you and your allies a +5 competence bonus to hit and doubles the range incriment of ranged weapons. You could make a pretty good Druid sniper with this and Hawkeye!The Ranger gets a few spells out of core.Arrow Mind [SpC] – Immediate action. A 1st level spell that let the caster threaten squares within their normal melee reach and avoid provoking Attacks of Opportunity when shooting.Guided Shot [SpC] – Swift action. A 1st level spell that lets you ignore range penalties due to distance and the AC bonus of any cover shot of total cover, and the miss chance granted by concealment less than total concealment.&amp;nbsp;Hawkeye [SpC] – 1st level spell. increases the range increment for ranged weapons you wield by 50%, and grants&amp;nbsp; +5 competence bonus on Spot checks.Hunter's Mercy [SpC] – Your next attack with a bow (not including crossbows) is an automatic critical hit. Must be used before the end of your next turn. As this is a standard action to cast, that makes it difficult to use.Sniper's Shot [SpC] – Swift action. 1st level spell that removes the distance limit on ranged Sneak Attacks for one round.Snowshoes [SpC] – Handy for the movement bonus and ability to avoid ice hazards. Strictly superior to Longstrider.Exacting Shot [SpC] – Swift action. 2nd level spell automatically confirms critical hits against favored enemies and ignores concealment less than total concealment..Haste, Swift [SpC] – Swift action. 2nd level spell which grants a personal Haste for 1d4 rounds. Not bad. Hunter's Eye [PHBII] – Swift action. A 2nd level spell which is a swift action to cast and grants +1d6 Sneak Attack damage/3 caster levels.Arrowsplit [CoR] – Swift action. A 3rd level spell which causes one masterwork arrow or bolt to split into 1d4+1 identical copies. All missiles strike the same target, and each has its own attack roll.FeatsAssume Supernatural Ability [SS, Pg. 30] – Requires Wis 13 and the ability to assume a new form magicallySupernatural abilities can be quite interesting, but this comes at a cost: you take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks, and in stressful situations (like cobmat), you must succeed on a DC 19 Will save in order to use the ability.Improved Assume Supernatural Ability [SS, Pg. 35] – Requires Assume Supernatural Ability, Wis 17, and the ability to assume a new form magicallyThis gets rid of the -2 penalty, but does not remove the need for a will save.Blindsense [CAdv, Pg. 114] – Requires Wild Shape, Listen 4 ranksExpend one use of Wild Shape to gain Blindsense for 1 minute per HD.Cheetah's Speed [CD, Pg. 79] – Requires Wild ShapeYou expend one use of Wild Shape to boost your base land speed to 50 feet per round for one hour and sprint like a cheetah once during that time. Could be useful for an archer.Climb Like an Ape [CAdv, Pg. 114] – Requires Wild ShapeYou can expend one use of Wild Shape to gain a climb speed equal to your base land speed for 10 minutes per HD. The feat also grants a +8 racial bonus to climb checks and the ability to take 10 on Climb checks. Not the most useful feat.Eagle's Wings [CD, Pg. 80] – Requires Wild ShapeYou expend one use of Wild Shape in order to fly like an eagle out to the sea. You gain a flight speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability for one hour.Natural Spell [SRD] – Requires Wis 13, wild shape ability.Spellcasting while shapeshifted is a no brainer.

For example, Thinblade linked to JanusJone's Glaivelock min-guide, but that was lost when the WotC forums died and I have yet to find a copy, so that line is has been omitted. The formatting has also been revised so the guide flows better.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;-Solo&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Warlock Information Compilation by Thinblade&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m a big fan of the warlock, but lately I’ve been growing more and more frustrated with how scattered optimization information is for it across the CO Board. A lot of good things have been posted, and many have either vanished or are buried in the very large Warlock Handbook thread. I’ve been especially annoyed that there isn’t a single list with all published invocations and their commentaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I’m not the best optimizer, but I can collate with the best of them. And I happen to be working on a large research paper, from which I need to take breaks. So I’ve decided to put together a single document, built around Tealgorthian’s original Warlock Handbook, that distills our commentaries on everything that’s been published since Complete Arcane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of what follows is not my work. Every comment and build is taken verbatim (though occasionally I’ve done a little copy editing) and is attributed to the original poster. The sole exception is the Invocation Critiques section, where posters are attributed at the top and the invocations are grouped by strength and type (essence, shape, or normal).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thinblade’s Compilation Introduction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warlock Handbook Introduction by Tealgorthian&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Two Most Important Questions by Thinblade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Races&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prestige Classes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invocation Guide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Miscellany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warlock Level 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizing Warlock Damage with Sneak Attack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dipping Incarnate for Hellfire Warlock&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Bloodlines/Legacy Champion/Uncanny Trickster to Increase Eldritch Blast Damage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making Nightcrawler (Shadowpounce builds)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tome of Battle’s Influence on Warlocks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apprentice Feats and their Value&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic Warlock Items&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Call of the Beast Invocation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternate Class Features&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple Warlock Trick – Wall of Gloom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warlock Feats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Epic Warlock Feats and Invocations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic Builds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advanced Builds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Warlock Handbook Introduction by Tealgorthian&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There's been a rash in Warlock threads here recently. So, for a class picking up in popularity I thought I’d start this thread. Warlock is my favorite class, ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Currently, search is down. I know a lot of good Warlock builds have been posted, so if you posted one and you want it here, please show it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warlock Pros&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A good skill list. It's a Cha based class with good Cha based skills, and it gets the eternally powerful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Magic Device. Three good solid Knowledge skills (Arcana, Planes, and Religion - almost the Big Four, if only it had Nature).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All their Invocations can be used in Light armor, with no ASF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unlimited uses of their Invocations, and Eldritch Blast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detect Magic at Will, with Caster Level equal to class level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability to take 10 on all UMD checks, even when distracted or threatened.

Good Invocations for this are: Beguiling Influence, Leaps and Bounds, Entropic Warding, See and Unseen, and Spiderwalk, depending on what you are trying to accomplish. A social Rogue, for example, could pick up a +6 unnamed bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate. A warrior could dip in for 1 level to get See the Unseen, which would grant Darkvision and See Invisibility.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dipping for a second level gets you Detect Magic at will, and a second Invocation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The max I would go for a dip into Warlock is 4, which nets you 3 Least Invocations, Detect Magic at will, Eldritch Blast 2d6 (Meh) Damage Reduction 1/Cold Iron, and Imbue Item, which gives you the awesome ability to take 10 on UMB checks, something shared only by the Artificer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Two Most Important Questions When Building Warlocks: by Thinblade&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lately, I’ve found myself typing more or less the same thing over and over again for beginners wanting to know how to build a warlock. Since it’s a popular topic, I decided to write down my thoughts in a more coherent manner, the better to help those in need.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the heart of any warlock build are two questions: melee or ranged, and Charisma or no Charisma.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Melee vs. Ranged&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Most warlocks want to be in melee combat about as much as your average wizard does: namely, they don’t want it the least little bit. While your slightly better hitpoints (d6), and the ability to wear light armor help, no one would ever confuse a warlock with a fighter. Coupled with a lack of martial weapon proficiency and good combat-boosting buffs (magic weapon, divine power, et. al), one would think no warlock in their right mind would want to get into melee.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Prior to the release of Dragon Magic, you would be correct. Hideous Blow, previously the only melee invocation, indeed blows hideously. It requires a normal melee attack to hit, can be disrupted like any other invocation, and only gives one attack. No one in their right might took it. However, with Complete Mage came Eldritch Glaive, and a whole new world opened.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Glaive is everything Hideous Blow should have been. It’s a touch attack, gives reach, and allows you to make iterative attacks. It has downsides as well (namely you can’t move while you do it and you can’t get extra attacks from things like haste), but it finally made warlocks viable in melee combat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the first two choices you have to make is whether you want to aim at becoming what JanusJones calls a “glaivelock,” or whether you want to focus on ranged combat only. Note that while a glaivelock does not have to glaive all the time, many of your feats, invocations, and likely also levels in other classes will focus on one area, and not the other. Your stats will likely follow suit as you try to get prereqs for combat feats and make sure you can be effective in close combat. This is why you’ll want to make this choice at character creation, even though a pure (or mostly pure) warlock probably won’t be getting eldritch glaive until you swap another invocation for it a level 6.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Either kind of character is completely viable, so make your choice based on what you want to play, and what other characters are in your group. If you’re interested in glaivelocks, I cannot recommend enough JanusJones’s guide.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Charisma vs. No Charisma&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A lot of people new to the warlock are under the impression that, just because the class description says that a high charisma is important to warlocks, that they need a high charisma. The truth is more complex: there are actually two kinds of warlock invocations: those that need charisma, and those that don’t. It is entirely possible to make a viable warlock and dump charisma, you just need to decide what you want your character to focus on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have a high charisma if you:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want to use a lot of eldritch essences (Noxious Blast, Repelling Blast, Utterdark Blast)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want to use invocations that require a save (Tenacious Plague, Word of Changing, Nightmares Made Real)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want to get a saving throw bonus through Dark One’s Own Luck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want to be a party face using beguiling influence, and need all the help you can get&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dump charisma if you:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are focusing on 24 hour buffs (Fell Flight, all the +6 to skills invocations, Dark Foresight, Walk Unseen, Entropic Warding)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are using invocations that do not require a save (Chilling Tentacles, Path of Shadows, Flee the Scene, Hellspawned Grace)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As you can see, a lot of the best invocations (Fell Flight, Flee the Scene, Chilling Tentacles, Walk Unseen) do not require charisma to be effective. Equally, a lot of the invocations that require saves are less than useful (Stony Grasp, Bewitching Blast, and Frightful Blast are all low-lights) The best save-requiring invocation is, far and away, Utterdark Blast. If you’re making it that far, UB by itself makes having a high charisma worth it. At lower levels, the choice is less clear-cut. Also, if you’re playing a good-aligned warlock, you might have some qualms throwing around negative energy at will.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I hope this discussion has cleared up what in my mind are the two primary questions a player must answer when designing a warlock. Everything else flows from the answer to melee vs ranged and charisma vs no charisma. Once you’ve decided, your statistics, your feats, your invocations, and everything else begins to become clear.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Races&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Player’s Handbook Races&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Halfling by Oogar&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am starting to see Halfling as a nice choice for Warlock race. Small size and a +2 dex basically adds a net of +2 to hit with the Eldritch Blasts and +2 AC. The Save bonus is nice and if you are in Forgotten Realms you can snag the extra feat with the one subrace (If you need the feat).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While you end up low in skill points, I expect that if you spend much time on this board, you will likely be spending your skill points in very specific ways anyhow. The loss of strength and weapon size do not really hinder too greatly, and use of Fell Flight or Flee the Scene can assist in the loss of movement speed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;For flavor it is rather easy for me to see a halfling that had an ancestor that tried to pull a fast one on an arch devil, or some big mucky muck from the abyss, and ended up passing along this little legacy to our little hero (anti-hero).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humans are always a viable option. Many warlock builds are feat starved, and, while they have a good list of skills, they lack skill points. Human helps with both of these. Human is also the only race (besides doppelganger) that can get Able Learner and become a Chameleon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other Races&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hellbred &lt;/b&gt;(Fiendish Codex II) by DastardlyDan:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;+2 racial bonus to Intimidate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evil Exception: Good-aligned Hellbred can use Evil-aligned items without penalty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Devil's Favor: Bonus feat (+2 bonus on any roll 1/day)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automatic Language: Infernal (Qualifier for Hellfire Warlock PrC)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infernal Aspect:&lt;/b&gt; Choose Body or Spirit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Body:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st Clvl: +4 save vs. poison, +2 Con, -2 Int&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th Clvl: Bonus Devil-Touched Feat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th Clvl: Bonus Devil-Touched Feat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Spirit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st Clvl: 30' Darkvision, +2 Sense Motive, +2 Cha, -2 Con&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th Clvl: 60' Darkvision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th Clvl: 120' Darkvision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th Clvl: Can see in any darkness, including magical as strong as Deeper Darkness spell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15th Clvl: Telepathy to 100'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hengeyokai &lt;/b&gt;– Crane, Sparrow (Oriental Adventures) by Thinblade:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The chaotic good animal shapechangers from Oriental Adventures make good fey-themed warlocks. In their hybrid form they gain a +2 Dex as well as a fly speed, freeing up one of the valuable lesser invocation spots for something other than Fell Flight. You can also use your invocations while in your animal form. (How do you know which of those flocking sparrows is the warlock? It’s the one throwing eldritch blasts at you.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note that the 3.5 update in Dragon 318 removed their +1 LA by making them Humanoid (shapechangers). This makes them much more attractive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jaebrin &lt;/b&gt;(Monster Manual 5) by Richmud and HelloRaptor&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[by Richmud]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've been looking at the Jaebrins from MM5 which have several interesting features that may prove useful for a warlock&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The get a charisma bonus, a bonus to bluff and diplomacy both handy for a warlock, a luck bonus to AC, immunity to enchantments and the ability to fake being enchanted which are just all around handy. Most interestingly they have a bite attack that can lower will saves. I can see it being quite good for a warlock as they can be capable enough in combat to bite a foe before unleashing something that requires a will save (charm always being a good option)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[by HelloRaptor]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stats: -2 Str, +2 Cha (add the Magic Blooded template for a nice -2 Str, -2 Wis, +2 Cha)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Misc Bonuses: +1 Luck to AC, Enchantment spells cast at +1 DC, +2 on Appraise, Bluff, Perform and Diplomacy checks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Natural Attack: Bite. Also acts as a special attack 'Will Sapper', any creature struck by it must make a DC (10+ConModifier+1/2 Class Levels) Will Save or suffer a -4 to Will saves for the next 10 rounds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Absorb Enchantment: Not only are Jaebrin immune to Enchantment spells and effects, they automatically know when they're Enchanted and what the intended effect is, and can feign being under its effect. Others have to beat them with Sense Motive vs a Bluff check to know they're faking.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All they have going against them is a Level Adjustment of +1. If you play in a game with LA buyoff (I do), buying this off is trivial.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karsite &lt;/b&gt;(Tome of Magic) by kadeity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Um, Karsite, the +2LA race from Tome of Magic, makes an amazing warlock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They get +2con &amp;amp; +2cha as well as spell resistance 10+class levels, and heal 2hp for every spell level of a spell that fails against their SR. Sure they cant be spellcasters, but they can use Spell like abilities normally. And a side note, they can be psions, not that it matters. they have another cool ability that makes a magic item inactive for a round. All this in addition to the human feat and skill points. I think the 2LA is worth it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway I'm saying this because i recall someone saying they couldn't find a good warlock race.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Petal &lt;/b&gt;(Monster Manual 3) by NatchFeral&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Petal [Tiny Fey] +2 LA, gives -8 Str +10 Dex +4 Con +4 Int +8 Cha&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With an elite array for ability scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 ) this could give you:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Str 4 Dex 24 Con 17 Int 14 Wis 8 Cha 23. Seems ideal for a warlock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pixie (Monster Manual 1) by mjung&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I personally like the pixie warlock. Sure, you pay 4 LA, but you more than make up with it with versatility and utter ridiculousness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Pixie gives you:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;+8 dex and +6 cha (amongst other stat adjustments)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small size. Harder to hit and easier to hit others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;60 foot (good) fly speed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dodge as a bonus feat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;+1 natural armor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DR 10/cold iron, Spell resistance 15+levels and persistent (suppressible) greater invisibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some nice SLAs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This race was made for warlocks. You can fly around, invisible and hurl little eldritch blasts at your enemies. Best thing is, you are virtually guaranteed damage and you are virtually untouchable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because Eldritch Blast is a ranged touch attack, your target gets no armor or natural armor bonuses to their AC.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unless your target can see invisibility, they further get no dex or dodge bonus to AC and you get a +2 on your attacks against sighted targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So let's see...they don't get dodge, dex, armor or natural armor bonuses...they still get um...size...and um...deflection. With +8 to your dex, some BAB, +2 for being invis and +1 for being small, you can virtually guarantee a hit EVERY TIME.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So what about when they strike back? Oh well, first they have to find you (invisible). Then they have to reach you somehow (flying). Then they have to hit you (small size and high dex). Then they have to overcome either your spell resistance or your damage reduction. Not very likely they'll be hitting you much.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can see where all this is going. Sure, a fighter could dish out more damage in one round. But your steady once per round 7d6 and nigh untouchability will certainly make you a force to be reckoned with. With the right feat selection and items, I truly believe this character would be just about invincible unless the DM specifically is trying to take you down. You can outlast just about anything in the game.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Primordial Giant Template&lt;/b&gt; (Secrets of Xen’drik) by tacoronte&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the most recent Eberron Setting book, Secrets of Xen’drik, there is a new template for Giants &quot;Primordial Giant&quot; that makes Warlock a favored class for the character, enhances mental stats (with penalty on physical), adds a Spell-like ability and gives a +1 bonus on caster level for Spell-like Abilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Best of all, it doesn't increase Level Adjustment; making something like an Ogre/Troll/Half-Giant more playable as a Warlock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For instance a Primordial Giant Ogre (LA +2) would have stat adjustments of +6 STR, -2 DEX, +2 CON, no mental penalties, and if you throw in Practiced Spellcaster, you are just 1 caster level behind a typical Warlock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That is a fair trade-off for a melee/hideous blow oriented Warlock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whisper Gnome&lt;/b&gt; (Races of Stone) by Eytan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whisper Gnomes make great Warlock/Arcane Tricksters. They have a more serious demeanor - perfect for warlocks, huge bonuses on stealth total +4 Move Silently + 8 hide, and they have mage hand as a spell like ability. Also, the +2 to dex and con is very nice. The -2 to charisma is a little tough, but this warlock build really doesn't rely too much on eldritch essence invocations, though they don't hurt. The invocations they really want are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Entropic Warding - good protection from ranged attacks which is really what they need because they don't want to be in melee. It also adds to their stealthiness by making it impossible to track them, even using scent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invisibility (or Improved Invisibility)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beguiling Influence - +6 diplomacy, bluff, intimidate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spider Climb&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flee the Scene - Short range dimension door + brief major image&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flight&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark Discorporation&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shadow Walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;I like these because they really compliment rogue (adding a lot of maneuverability, which in term increases defense). Also, they fit the shadowy sneakiness of rogues. You also have a crazy magical sneak attack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Xeph &lt;/b&gt;(Expanded Psionics Handbook) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Xephs deserve a special mention since they are innately psionic. This opens the door to taking Psionic Shot, Greater Psionic Shot, and Psionic Meditation without having to spend a feat on Wild Talent or lose caster levels dipping into Psion or Psychic Warrior. Their +2 Dex is also nice for hitting with your eldritch blast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prestige Classes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Core and Complete Books&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Arcane Trickster &lt;/b&gt;(DMG) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A way to advance invocations and sneak attack. Requires the feat spell hand (Complete Arcane) and a lesser invocation, plus 2d6 sneak attack. This is one of the few classes with the requirement “one spell of X level,” which let warlocks enter, as opposed to “spells of X level,” which don’t. A neat trick, if you don’t want to give up three levels to thief, is to instead use the feats Martial Study and Martial Stance to get Assassin’s Stance. Since you can be in a stance indefinately and can’t be knocked out of it, you can use it to qualify for any PrC that requires sneak attack dice. It doesn’t help with the ranks in thief skills, though (7 ranks in Disable Device, Decipher Script, and Escape Artist). Apprentice won’t help here, which means you’ll need to be human or have a high Int, and be at least level 11.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note: If you have the Planar Handbook, go join the Society of Sensation. A human Ardent Dilettante gets 7 + Int skill points into any skill. The PrC costs you a caster level, but boy does it do a number on skill reqs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blood Magus &lt;/b&gt;(Complete Arcane) h/t DastardlyDan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another of the rare PrC’s requiring “caster level,” Blood Magus is most likely a 4 level PrC, and a sub-par one at that. It’s 8/10 casting, losing levels at 5 and 10, which is bad enough, but it&amp;nbsp; requires two dud feats for entry. One of them is Toughness, arguably the worst feat ever printed, certainly the worst in Core. and the fact that many of the abilities, like blood component and several abilities after you lose a caster level at 5, don’t work with invocations. If you really want to take this PrC, talk to your DM about allowing you take Improved Toughness from Complete Warrior instead. It also requires that you have died and been brought back, which is problematical at low levels of play (though, arguably, the Hellbred race gets this by default). Probably best taken with crafter warlocks to get the free brew potion and scribe scroll feats, but since you give up two feats to get in, and both feats are limited by your body, I’d rather just take the feats and leave the PrC alone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Daggerspell Mage&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Adventurer) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another way to get sneak attack, this is the easiest PrC to get into, requiring two useless feats (weapon focus: dagger and two weapon fighting) and one level of thief (or Assassin’s Stance). Unfortunately, none of the class features work with invocations, so you pretty much just get sneak attack. Personally, I’d go with Arcane Trickster.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Divine Oracle (Complete Divine) by Thinblade: A warlock can get into this class with two divination invocations by 5th level. Unfortunately, there are only two divination invocations in Complete Arcane, see the unseen and dark foresight, and dark foresight is Dark, so of limited use. Things like Devil’s Sight don’t help, since they don’t copy divination spells. If you have Complete Mage, however, there is one more divination: all-seeing eyes, which isn’t all that bad and allows you to qualify with two least invocations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The class itself is 10/10 spellcasting and gives trap sense, a better form of evasion, and improved uncanny dodge. Unfortunately, most of the other abilities don’t work with warlock invocations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eldritch Disciple&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Mage) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This class is perhaps unique in that it is a dual-progression PrC that doesn’t require you to be third level in both classes before entering. Definitely cleric-centered, since you need 2nd level divine spells but only least invocations. You lose a divine caster level at level one as well, but for two levels of cleric casting you get eleven on warlock, plus yet more options for things to do with turn undead attempts instead of, oh, turning undead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eldritch Theurge&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Mage) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A more standard double progression PrC, which requires 2nd level arcane spells and 2d6 blast, the Theurge has some nice synergy between the two sides of the class. Characters in the class are probably going to be blasters (whether wizard blasters or warlock blasters) so make sure that’s the role you want to play. Also, decide whether you want to use Spellweave, because if you do you’ll want to pick up some eldritch essences to apply to your spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enlightened Spirit &lt;/b&gt;(Complete Mage) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good in concept, horrible in execution. Enlighened Spirit is an attempt to make a PrC for a “redeemed” warlock. Unfortunatetly, it doesn’t advance invocations at all. Instead you get a few specific invocations (a fell flight duplicate, tongues, any blast shape that’s not Dark, and a couple of anti-fiend and undead blasts). The only good thing about it is that it increases blast damage 1d6/2 levels, but really, with Hellfire Warlock, why would you bother? Maybe worth it for a 1 level dip if you’re constantly fighting incorporeal stuff and the miss chance is messing with you, otherwise, stay away.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fortune’s Friend &lt;/b&gt;(Complete Scoundrel) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The lucky warlock. I’m including this one for completeness. Its abilities are neat and it’s really easy to enter, but it’s only 2/5 spellcasting. For my money, you give up too much just to be lucky.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil &lt;/b&gt;by Thinblade:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oddly enough, the warlock can get into one of the more powerful wizard PrC’s, due to IotSV’s entry requirement of “5 abjuration spells, 2 of which must be 4th level or higher.” Just take entropic shield (least), cold comfort (lesser), voracious dispelling (lesser, 4th), relentless dispelling (lesser, 4th), and devour magic (greater, 6th). Of course, that means you have to spend three of your seven total invocations on different ways of doing the exact same thing: dispel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can, of course, dip a level in another spellcasting class to pick up some abjuration spells. The obvious one is wizard, for Warlock 12/Wizard 1/IotSV 7. You’ll still need to keep devour magic and one of the other two dispel magic invocations, but you could free up to three other invocations. To avoid multiclassing penalties, you could also take a level in a separate spellcasting PrC, like Nentyar Hunter (Unapproachable East), Prime Underdark Guide (Underdark), or Ur-Priest. The easiest I’ve found to enter so far is Holy Liberator. Any of these options loses you a dark invocation, but gets you back up to three least and lesser invocations. If you go this path, you should probably also pick up Caster's Lament (and swap devour magic out for something else) so you can put all your bonuses to work counterspelling.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Invisible Blade&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Warrior) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yet another way to get sneak attack for your warlock, this time without multiclassing into thief. However, sneak attack is the only thing this PrC has going for it: it doesn’t increase invocations or your blast, and requires two useless feats - far shot and weapon focus: dagger. Arcane trickster will end up giving you more sneak attack dice and cost you two fewer levels of invocations, which gives you the Dark invocations you miss this way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mindbender&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Arcane) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Generally considered a one level only PrC, Mindbender works as well for a warlock as a wizard, though you must take the Charm invocation and therefore be at least level 6. If you take this, also take the Mindsight feat from Lords of Madness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mythic Exemplar&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Champion) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This class is easy to get into (BAB +5), but doesn’t offer a tremendous amount back. You lose a caster level at Level 1, and the gained abilties are more geared towards wizards and based off of Intelligence. Not useless, but not great either. Also, don’t take the last level. You lose another caster level, and you don’t have any arcane spells to convert to divinations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paragnostic Apostle&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Champion) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another easy class to get into (three Rank 5 Knowledge skills), and depending on the campaign, could be valuable. It’s 5/5 spellcasting, and offers a range of abilities based off of Knowledge. A few of the better ones: +1 to hit anything with natural armor, +1 to DC of any secondary blast effect with a saving throw (and maybe also things like chilling tentacles), and a favored enemy look-alike. If you’re already going the sage route, have skill points to burn, or are looking for any way to increase blast DC’s, look into this one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uncanny Trickster&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Scoundrel) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you’re using skill tricks, this isn’t necessarily a bad class. It’s three levels long, only requires skills and skill tricks to enter, and is 2/3 advancing of previous class abilities (just like Legacy Chamion). This can be used to get another +4d6 hellfire, if you’ve already taken Hellfire Warlock.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unseen Seer&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Mage) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warning! This class needs some finagling to enter. Check with your DM. A better way of getting sneak attack than something like Daggerspell Mage, this class will require a one level dip into another arcane spellcasting class and a bunch of sneaky cross-class skills to enter (beguiler is recommended, since one level gets you both). Once in, apply your +1 to caster level to warlock, not whatever you used to get in. Many of the bonus features don’t work with invocations, but you do get permanent non-detection, sneak attack, and a bunch of low-level divination spells (like true strike).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note: As if this class needed another note, you also need to check with your DM as to whether the Seer’s ability will grant you sneak attack dice if you don’t already have them. The class doesn’t say, and SA dice aren’t required to enter, unlike, say Arcane Trickster.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Virtuoso&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Adventurer) by Vainglory&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Virtuoso looks like a decent warlock prestige class, and the flavor fits great with a fey oriented warlock. Drawbacks are no spell progression first level, and getting 10 perform. To reach the 10 perform required you could take level 1 as human paragon, or be a rogue with able learner. The Apprentice: Entertainer feat (DMG II) could also help the pain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solo: Marshal gets Perform as a class skill, which may be useful if you have a high Charisma score.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warshaper&lt;/b&gt; (Complete Warrior) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Simple to enter if your DM allows you to take the Dragonfire Adept invocation Humanoid Shape (and if you can, you should). It doesn’t advance warlock casting, but does give a number of nice benefits: immunity to critical hits, an essentially-permanent +4 Str/Con, +5 feet of reach, and eventually permanent fast healing. I generally wouldn’t go more than two or three levels, unless you’re aiming for a bladelock. In any event, don’t take it all the way, since the level 5 ability may or may not work. It allows you to change shape as a move action, but Humanoid Shape is an invocation. Check with your DM about how it interacts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wild Mage (Complete Arcane) by Thinblade: The crazy warlock. This one requires talking to your DM. First see if you can substitute a meta-SLA feat for the required metamagic feat, otherwise you’ll be stuck with Sudden Quicken. Second, ask whether the Wild Mage ability applies to your eldritch blast, as well as your invocations. Then think hard about whether you want to introduce that much chaos into your gaming group. Most players try to minimize chaos.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you do decide to go for it, the class is 10/10 spellcasting, requires the aforementioned metamagic feat, a dud feat (Magical Aptitude), and some skills that you were probably getting anyway. And at level 10 it offers a nice way of making an enemy mage have a very bad day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Races Books&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chameleon&lt;/b&gt; (Races of Destiny) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Primarily used as a 2 level dip to get the floating feat, which can be used to get almost any invocation (through extra invocation), or almost any item creation feat, if you’re focusing on crafting. Note, however, that you cannot use the arcane or divine focus to get into otherwise barred PrC’s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ruathar&lt;/b&gt; (Races of the Wild) by Tealgorthian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Really easy requirements. Easier than most any PrC in print, I think. It also has 3/3 +1 spellcasting levels, and some minor benefits. The most useful of which are the minor magic item you are given, and the extended lifespan. Also, it expands your skill list a bit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade note: Ruathar has the wonderful ability of having all Knowledge skills as class skills. This allows a warlock to get PrC skill requirements (like Nature or Survival) much faster than on their own without having to sacrifice invocations and blast progression multiclassing. Adding ruathar to the mix suddenly makes things like Sentinel of Bharri and Swanmay easy without the messiness the Apprentice feat can open up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scar Enforcer&lt;/b&gt; (Races of Destiny) by surreal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Scar enforcer is a rather underwhelming PrC, but in this case it's very good for a multiclass warlock with rogue or ranger levels who wants to focus on being social and stealthy. Invocations like Entropic Shield hides your movement, big boosts to your skills with Leaps and Bounds and Beguiling Influence, the various movement granters, etc&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade note: It’s 5/10 spellcasting, grants +3d6 sneak attack, and has a whole bunch of thief-type skills. Not great, but at least it’s another option for those of you dying to have both sneak attack and some amount of invocation progression.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shadowcraft Mage&lt;/b&gt; (Races of Stone) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With the release of Complete Mage, the warlock gained the ability to enter the Shadowcraft Mage prestige class by using Walk Unseen, Wall of Gloom, and Nightmares Made Real (one good, one bad, and one iffy invocation). However, since no invocation duplicates figment or shade illusions, the best parts of the class are unavailable. The only class feature that actually works is cloak of shadow. Still, if an invocation ever gets published that mimics, say, Major Image, this would suddenly become an amazing class for warlocks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;General D&amp;amp;D Books&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ardent Dilettante&lt;/b&gt; (Planar Handbook) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This one’s so weird I just have to go try to make one. 9/10 spellcasting, but requiring increasingly difficult requirements to advance. By the end, you have to have skills all over the place, be able to cast both arcane and divine 1st level spells, proficiency with martial and exotic weapons, and have died (that one won’t be a problem). I have no idea whether or not you could optimize an ardent dilettante, but it sure would be different! Since all skills are class skills, you can take a few levels to satisfy another PrC’s skill req’s (arcane trickster, I’m looking at you), though you lose a caster level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Child of Night&lt;/b&gt; (Tome of Magic) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If it weren’t for its being 9/10 casting and requiring one of the worst invocations to enter (darkness), this would be a great PrC. As it is, it’s still good, and is one of the better fits thematically. Want a dark, spooky, more-than-human warlock? Look no further. Not all of the shadowy invocations are great, but there’s enough of them for you to fill your roster and still be useful. And never needing to eat or breathe is also nice. Since you’re stuck with darkness, you can also look into the various darkness feats in Drow of the Underdark.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demonbinder&lt;/b&gt; (Drow of the Underdark) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Must be a drow warlock. Gain a variety of abilities by binding demons to yourself, each demon giving a different set of abilities that can be easily changed between battles. Make sure you can buy off the LA before thinking about this one, though, since warlocks deal with caster level loss even worse than most casters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disciple of Asmodeus&lt;/b&gt; (Book of Vile Darkness) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As scrollreader says: “The eeeeeeevil warlock.” Fits thematically, is easy to enter (just two class skills, one cross-class skill, and a couple of feats), and gives 6/10 spellcasting, which means one dark invocation at level 20. Also gives the ability to cast charm person, which allows you to dip into Mindbender without wasting an invocation on Charm. See the builds section for an example.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fleshwarper&lt;/b&gt; (Lords of Madness) by Chemus&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Requires the feats Find Familiar (Complete Arcane) and Graft Flesh, plus points in a cross-craft skill (Heal), but grants 9/10 spellcasting and turns you into an aberration at 10th level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hellfire Warlock&lt;/b&gt; (Fiendish Codex II) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ultimate in warlock blasting. A nifty little 3 level PrC that gives +6d6 blast and 3/3 invocations, and all it wants is a mediocre blast essence in return. If you’re ok with the flavor, there’s very little reason not to take this class. See also: Legacy Champion PrC, Strategies Section.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note: There are huge, vicious thread wars being fought over the legality and practicality of the two prime ways to heal/negate the Con damage: the incarnum soulmeld Strongheart Vest and the vestige Naberius. Everyone agrees that simply getting Naberius through a feat doesn’t work (you can’t bind him and get the ability healing). Everyone also agrees that taking one level of Binder and then binding Naberius works. But that loses you a level of warlock, which is the same that happens if you take a level of incarnate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The wars are over whether the vest, taken through a feat (which means it always reduces ability damage by 1) violates the class ability, which says “(if) you are somehow immune to Constitution damage you cannot use this ability.” One side says that since hellfire ever only deals one point of damage, the vest makes you immune to the hellfire damage, and therefore you can’t use it. The other side counters that DR 1/- doesn’t mean you’re immune to physical damage, and neither does this, and besides, flavor-wise, what you’re doing is siphoning off energy from the souls of the multiverse to your selfish ends, which fits the theme of the Nine Hells to a tee. We’ve been arguing since the class first appeared, and no consensus has been reached, nor does it look like it ever will. End result: check with your DM.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keeper of the Cerulean Sign&lt;/b&gt; (Lords of Madness) by Chemus&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Requires the feat Aberration Banemagic, which has no prereqs but may or may not work with invocations (talk to your DM). The class itself is still open, even if you can’t get the +2d6 to aberrations, though, and is 10/10 spellcasting. Requires two cross-craft skills, as well (Gather Information 5 and Knowledge – Dungeoneering 8 )&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade note: This is actually a lot harder to get into than it looks, since you have to create a wondrous item by yourself, which requires Warlock 12. Since you can’t get 8 ranks of Dungeoneering until level 13, your maximum level in KotCS is 7 pre-epic. If you can take the Apprentice: Philosopher or Spellcaster feat (DMG II), or Education (FRCS/EbCS) to make Dungeoneering a class skill, you can get in a level early (and pick up a cohort in the process with a 1st level feat). Can't get around the crafting requirement, however.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legacy Champion&lt;/b&gt; (Weapons of Legacy) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Legacy Champion is an odd duck. It’s a PrC that offers 8/10 advancement of your original class abilities. This is the only way to continue to advance things like your DR, fiendish resilience, or energy resistance as well as your invocations and blast. For pure blaster warlocks willing be a little cheesy (though completely RAW-legal), use Legacy Champion to advance Hellfire Warlock for truly awe-inspiring eldritch blasts (and 2 dark invocations). And this is in addition to all of the abilities tied to legacy items. Restriction: you must have a legacy item, so if they aren’t in your game, you’re out of luck.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platinum Knight&lt;/b&gt; (Draconomicon) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the old-style gish PrC’s, Platinum Knight gives BAB +10 and 5/10 spellcasing. Of note is the 5th level ability which adds Cha bonus to saves (stacks with divine grace). It requires +5 BAB to enter, so a pure warlock would need to be level 7 to enter.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sand Shaper&lt;/b&gt; (Sandstorm) by Tealgorthian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To me, the jury is still out on this one. It's 8/10 +1 spellcasting, but you don’t get many of the major class features of the PrC. Really, the only things you do get are Sandform, Sandstride (Improved) Sand Shape, Desert Slumber and Desert Shroud. The PrC is cool, and flavorful, but you want to get the best out of it, play a Sorcerer or Warmage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sentinel of Bharri &lt;/b&gt;(Book of Exalted Deeds) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rangers, eat your heart out. The sentinel is a full casting PrC that gives a host of wilderness abilities (including Track, bonuses to Hide, and bear shape and summoning) and four energy resistances. The only problem is that you need Knowledge (nature) 8 and a couple of exalted feats. You can get around the skill problem with the feat Educated (FRCS/EbCS), but it doesn’t really fit thematically, and it means your early levels are feat-strapped. Still, it’s one of only two primary caster exalted PrC’s, and the easier to get into. See the builds section for an example.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade note: You know, sometimes I should read my own guide. Warlock 6/Ruathar 3 gives the needed skills without Education, freeing a feat and removing the necessity of using campaign-specific material. Ruathar also fits much better, thematically, than Education. Your other option is Apprentice: Woodsman, but you’ll need to be human to get in with Warlock 5.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Swanmay&lt;/b&gt; (Book of Exalted Deeds) by Thinblade: I knew if I looked hard enough I could find a use for Call of the Wild (CM), the invocation that grants wild empathy and speak with animals, and I finally have. The swanmay, a 9/10 spellcasting class that requires both. Unfortunately, it also requires two woodsy skills that the warlock doesn’t get, and one of them’s Survival, which means Education won’t help. A pure warlock won’t get in until level 14.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is where the PrC Ruathar (see above) really comes in handy. It has both skills, and enough skill points to get both up to 8 in three levels (neglecting everything else, but hey). Now you can get in as a Warlock 6/Ruathar 3, instead of Warlock 13. Like Sentinal of Bharri, a Warlock 5 with Apprentice: Woodsman can also get in, but you’ll need to be human or use flaws for all the feats. If you’re using the warlock variant that has your power coming from fey, this is a great PrC for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also note that the text states that it only increases druid and ranger spellcasting. If you’re using a fey-themed warlock you should be able to talk your DM into letting it also advance warlock, but it doesn’t straight out of the book.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Talon of Tiamat&lt;/b&gt; (Draconomicon) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Talon of Tiamat is another 5/10 spellcasting PrC that’s easier to enter than Platinum Knight (any evil, +4 BAB, a feat, and ranks in three class skills), but it only gives medium BAB instead of PK’s good. In return, you get an increasingly powerful breath weapon, immunity to one energy type, frightful presence, and possibly your very own dragon (via dominate dragon). You also get a bonus to Bluff and Intimidate, which, combined with Beguiling Influence can lead to some really high scores. Not a bad bunch of abilities, if you don’t mind losing dark invocations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Topaz Guardian&lt;/b&gt; (Lords of Madness) by Chemus:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You have to be Chaotic Good, and it can’t be entered until 8th level (need BAB +5). It’s 3/5 spell progression, but +5 BAB (Warlock 15/TG 5 = BAB +16) with protecting aspects from the Topaz Diadem, so it might be useful for melee warlocks, especially glaivelocks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urban Savant&lt;/b&gt; (Cityscape, p. 100) by Thinblade, h/t Surreal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A 9/10 casting PrC that doesn’t lose a level until 10 (in exchange for an ability duplicated by a first level spell… ugh), you’re going to have to do some tap dancing to get in, as none of the four knowledge skills required are gained by the warlock. You’re going to want some combination of the following: able learner feat, educated feat, or the Paragnostic Apostle or Ruathar PrC’s. In return, you get a larger number of skill points and some archivist-like abilities to identify enemy weaknesses. Plus, you’re a walking library. Warlock 6/Paragnostic Apostle 5/Urban Savant 9 will have of ranks in seven different knowledge skills (Arcana, Religion, and Planes for PA, then Dungeoneering, Local, Nature, and History for UA).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visionary Seeker&lt;/b&gt; (Planar Handbook) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sure, a warlock can easily enter this class (all you need is Knowledge (any) 8 ), but why would you want to? It’s 5/10 spellcasting and you can’t make use of the divination boost. Spell mimic could be really cool (cast any spell you’ve seen in the past 24 hours, of a level up to your VS level), but you can’t use it very often.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Forgotten Realms Books&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crinti Shadow Marauder&lt;/b&gt; (Shining South) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the few PrC’s to give Shadow Pouncing (the ability to make a full attack after teleporting). See numerous shadow pounce builds scattered throughout the board for how deadly this can be. Doesn’t get the ability until the end of this 5 level class, and you need the feats Mounted Combat and Stealthy, and a whole host of cross-class skills. Oh, and by the way, you have to be half-drow (Crinti). You only need flee the scene if you want to shadow pounce off your horse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord&lt;/b&gt; (Unapproachable East) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other primary shadow pouncing PrC. Gets the ability at level 4, but requires Flee the Scene, multiclassing, and a bunch of feats. Shadow pounce just isn’t easy to get. See my treatise on building Nightcrawler in the Miscellany section for an example of shadow pouncing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Eberron Books&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cyran Avenger&lt;/b&gt; (5 Nations) by Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A 4/5 spellcasting, +5 BAB class that gives some interesting options for a warlock. Avenging strike adds Cha to attack and 1d6 damage/Avenger level to anyone who’s attacked any member of your party (much like a paladin’s smite). At 3rd level you can apply it to your eldritch blast and go to town. This class gives you a reason to have a high Charisma, so also pick up invocations that have save DC’s as well. Probably requires multiclassing into ranger to pick up required BAB, Survival, and Track.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are two other options for entry. The first is the Apprentice: Woodsman feat from DMG II, which can then be parlayed into Leadership at level 10. Be sure you’re willing to put the time in, however. The other is Sentinal of Bharri, which gives everything warlock lacks. Go human warlock 5/SB 10/CA 5 and unleash angry bears on those who dared to attack your home!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Escalation Mage&lt;/b&gt; (Faiths of Eberron) by widow&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Two easy skill req's, one metamagic feat, caster level 5th, and you must worship the shadow (Eberron specific). It is 6 levels long and nets you a number of extend, empower, widen, quicken, and heighten spells or spell-like abilities a day. Also gives full caster progression.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Primal Scholar&lt;/b&gt; (Eberron: SoX) by Part-Human2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5 lvl PrC - full caster progression but requires Mysterious Magic feat, a Metamagic feat and 10 ranks in Knowledge (history) which are a waste to get.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Invocation Guide&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade’s note: Invocations from Complete Arcane were written by Tealgorthian and are unmarked. Dragon Magic warlock (DM) and dragonfire adept (DA) invocations were written by cheezgrater. Complete Mage (CM) and Cityscape invocations were written by Richmud. Magic of Incarnum invocations written by FromTheShadows. Drow of the Underdark (DotU) invocations written by Lone Wolf.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;cheezgrater’s note about Dragonfire Adept invocations: These invocations are originally intended for the Dragonfire Adept (which functions like a warlock with breath weapons instead of eldritch blast). Use of these would require DM permission. However, since a lot of draconic invocations duplicate or are comparable to warlock invocations, it should be fairly easy to convince your DM to allow some of these. I have only selected the extremely useful invocations that can be justified for flavor with the Warlock. (Terrifying Roar and Frightful Presence just don't work for flavor).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Eldritch Essences&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eldritch Essences, Least&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Frightful Blast: Handy for a low level VS will save, but the fact it doesn’t stack reduces it's viability quite a bit. If you take it at low levels, I'd suggest replacing it with something stronger ASAP.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hammer Blast (CM): You deal full damage to objects. Doesn't strike me as that necessary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sickening Blast: I prefer this to Frightful Blast, but most monsters tend to have a better Fort save than Will, which, again, limits it's uses. Another one that needs to be replaced ASAP.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eldritch Essences, Lesser&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Baneful Blast (CM): 2d6 extra vs. selected type. Unless you are in a campaign fighting a lot of SR free creatures of the same type, it’s not going to help you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beshadowed Blast: Another Fort save Essences, and somewhat better than Sickening Blast. Blinding your enemy can be just as effective as Invisibility sometimes. A good low level power, but should be replaced.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Brimstone Blast: Your first Ref save blast, and it's pretty crappy. It can be easily simulated with something like Alchemist's Fire. I'd only take this if you seem to be facing an abnormal amount of creatures that need fire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Deteriorating Blast (DM): Extremely useful against foes with DR. The ability to drop DR by 5 points can greatly shorten encounters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hellrime Blast: The only stat affecting Essence, and it turns out to be a penalty instead of damage. Mediocre at best. I'd take Beshadowed Blast over this, they are both Fort targeting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eldritch Essences, Greater&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bewitching Blast: Meh. I've never even considered taking this power. The duration is too short for me to consider. There are MUCH better Essences at this level you can take.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hindering Blast (CM): Save vs. slow, could be useful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Incarnum Blast (Incarnum): The usefulness of this depends on how far your alignment varies from that of your enemies. If it doesn't, this invocation is useless. If it does, you have a source of dazing and possible bonus damage. Not exceptional, but not horrible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Noxious Blast: If you still have Sickening Blast, you should definitely dump it now, and take this power in it's place. This Invocation can take a monster out of the fight for 1 min. Awesome.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Penetrating Blast (DM): A blaster's best friend +4 bonus on checks to beat SR, plus a hit drops the target's SR by 5. This makes high SR enemies much more manageable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Repelling Blast: A kind of middle of the road blast. I use it with things like Chilling Tentacles and Wall of Perilous Flame. If you want a straight blaster, look else where. If you are going for battlefeild control, this is the blast for you!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vitriolic Blast: The king of the Greater Essences, this is the -only- Essence that allows you to ignore SR, and is therefore a must have in my book. It makes you viable in combat against high SR monsters, and the bane of all casters, Golems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eldritch Essence, Dark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bind Blast (CM): Save vs. stun for 1 round. It seems too short to waste a dark invocation on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Utterdark Blast: My personal favorite blast, it's the only way a Warlock can deal negative levels. Given time, he can reduce even the most powerful enemy to almost nil. Seems to be the most effective when used with any of the AoE Shapes (Cone, Doom, and Chain)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Blast Shapes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blast Shapes, Least&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Glaive (DM): A must-have for any warlock that ever finds himself in melee; reach, iterative attacks, and attacks of opportunity with your eldritch blast make this invocation a no-brainer&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Spear: The usefulness of this invocation varies greatly depending on the style of Warlock you wish to play. A long range sniper will get the most use, but remember that using this Shape denies you the use of higher level shapes. I have yet to take this ability.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hideous Blow: The primary shape of all Melee Warlocks (before Dragon Magic). It can give the Warlock an almost-like Sneak Attack ability. Again, use varies on play style.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade note: Almost no one took this before Dragon Magic. Now, no one takes it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blast Shapes, Lesser&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Chain: Less useful than some other shapes, it can be used to Repel multiple targets, or issue multi-target debuffs, till you run out of Blast damage. My favorite combination is Chain + Utterdark Blast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blast Shapes, Greater&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Cone: I find this to be the least useful of the AoE Shapes, but many, many others disagree with me. It offers one of the largest AoE effects, and doesn’t require the Ranged Touch attack. It does offer a Ref save for half damage. Could be useful with Fell Flight and fired from straight above.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Line (DM): Meh. Eldritch Blast as a line attack. In most situations Cone or Chain are going to be better.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blast Shapes, Dark&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Doom: This Shape puts the Warlock were he doesn’t really wanna be: in the middle of all the fighting. That's the only way it is effective. Melee Warlocks can find this power useful if they are surrounded. Combined with Repelling Blast, it can even the odds fairly quickly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Least Invocations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All Seeing Eyes (CM): Search and spot bonus and comprehend language for written things. Not bad for a scouting/spying oriented warlock&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Baleful Utterance: Unlimited Shatters as the spell. very very very useful.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beguiling Influence: Will see the most use in Warlocks that want to make good negotiator. The use is limited because Diplomacy is not a class skill for Warlocks, sadly. If you add levels of a social class (Rogue, Bard) the usefulness of this Invocation increases.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Breath of the Night: I've not found a use for this Invocation yet. Fog Cloud can be a handy spell, but one that can be more easily duplicated with a magic item.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Call of the Beast (CM): Wild empathy and speak with animals, very nice for RP if you going for a fey flavored warlock. (See also note in Miscellany.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cocoon of refuse (Cityscape): Entangle a target while in a city, lasts 1 round/level or until they escape. Not a bad least if you remain in cities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dark One's Own Luck: A luck bonus to your saves based on your Charisma for 24 hours, but limited by your class level. It cant be used on more than 1 save at a time. That makes me less than excited about it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Darkness: The 3.5 version of Darkness is pretty crappy. If you used the 3.0 version.. yeah, go for it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Devil's Sight: When the Warlock was first introduced, there was a lot of excitement about this combined with Darkness, but it turns out that it isn’t all it's cracked up to be. There are better things to use your Invocation slots on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Drain Incarnum (Incarnum) - Crap. Wow, you can do a single point of Wisdom or essentia damage and they get a save? Not worth it, even at lower levels. Easily one of the worst invocations published.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Earthen Grasp: Since the spell sucks, I think this invocation sucks too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Endure Exposure (DA): Endure Elements could be very useful during planar travel or in harsh environments. One of the few buffs you could share with your party. (Ignore line regarding granting immunity to your breath weapon).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Entropic Warding: This Invocation is so good, I don’t know what else to say. 20% miss chance from ranged attacks, leaving no trail, cant be tracked by scent? Wow.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leaps and Bounds: Might be good for multi-class Warlocks that get those skills on their list. Rogue and Monks come to mind immediately.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Miasmic Cloud: Easy to catch your allies inside, easily dispersed. Might make a good low level Invocation to swap out later&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Otherworldly Whispers (CM): Bonuses on 3 kinds of knowledge checks(predetermined) Useful if you are expected to be the one making those knowledge checks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See the Unseen: One of the best of the Least Invocations. 24 hour See Invisibility -and- Darkvision. I'll take two, and an order of fries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Serpents Tongue (CM): You get scent and a bonus vs. poison, scent is useful to make this worthwhile&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Soulreaving Aura (CM): You damage creatures that are at or below 0hp, the temp hp it provides when something dies only last for a round and that’s not enough to make it worthwhile.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spiderwalk: A great power for those Warlocks seeking to enhance their mobility options, esp. in caves, buildings, and cities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Summon Swarm: A decent low level power, the duration prevents you from summoning 400 Swarms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swimming the Styx (CM): You get a swim speed equal to land speed and can breath water. Useful in a campaign with a lot of water.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesser Invocations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Charm: Another solid invocation, this one can give you a temporary cohort. Can also be used to qualify for the Mindbender PrC&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cold Comfort (CM): Endure elements for you and everyone in 30ft, unusual for effecting allies. Good if the game is set in a harsh environment otherwise probably not a common enough need.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Crawling Eye (CM): You detach your eye and send it out to spy. It’s good for scouting and spying. It’s also creepy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Curse of Despair: Not all that useful, since you need to be close enough to touch the target, but given that Bestow Curse can be a powerful ability, I say it depends on your Warlock-style.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Dead Walk: If you use the black onyx you can create an undead army in a day. Even without the onyx, it is a good ability to make a quick zombie in the middle of combat. If you take Utterdark Blast, you can heal your undead minions. With Eldritch Chain you can heal multiple targets. With Eldritch Cone you can heal your undead while affecting your enemies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Disembodied Hand (CM): You detach your hand and let it fly around. It can wield a weapon and get up into combat without endangering you as much, also good for delivering a touch spell. It’s more creepy then effective though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dread Seizure (DM): Hrmm...this invocation isn't bad, but there are several that are better. Half movement and reduced reach attacks are nice, but the duration is too short and you are too limited in invocation selection to waste time with this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enthralling Voice (DA): The ability to fascinate listeners can potentially be useful for a skill/talk oriented warlock. Not very useful in combat (at least, not very often).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fell Flight: The crown jewel of Warlock mobility, the spell can give you flight you can turn on and off all day long. Awesome invocation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Flee the Scene: Another awesome mobility invocation. A good way to create confusion among your enemies. Too bad the range was shortened so much.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humanoid Shape (DA) (TB): Humanoid shape, if allowed (it’s technically a Dragonfire Adept invocation), is easily one of the best lesser invocations ever printed. Assume the form of any humanoid creature. Become an avariel and fly faster than Fell Flight (though with average, not good, maneuverability). Use to get a large bonus on disguise checks anywhere. And it can also be used to enter the Warshaper prestige class.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hungry Darkness: I'm not sure what the use of this Invocation is. It only lasts if you concentrate, and it's only Darkness with a bat swarm. Seems useless.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ignore the Pyre (DM): Energy resistance equal to your caster level? Very useful (you can have resistance to three types between this invocation and your class features).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mask of Flesh (CM): You take on the appearance of someone you touch, and can also give them a cha penalty. It’s interesting though quite limited.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Relentless Dispelling (CM): Targeted dispel two rounds in a row for just one standard action sounds like a deal.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spider-shape (DotU): Lets you transform yourself into a fiendish spider of Small or Medium size. This is a polymorph effect, and the invocation scales as you gain levels, increasing the range of sizes you can assume. At 8th level, you add Large to list of possible sizes; at 11th, you add Tiny; at 15th, Huge; and at 20th level, Gargantuan. Lasts a number of hours equal to your caster level or until you choose to end it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Steal Incarnum (Incarnum): Nothing fantastic, even if you're playing in an Incarnum-heavy game. If you aren't, avoid this invocation like the plague.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stony Grasp: Just as useless as Earthen Grasp.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sudden Swarm (DotU): Lasts 24 hours or until its effect is triggered. When you kill a creature with one of your invocations (including eldritch blast), a swarm of spiders bursts from the corpse. Has the statistics of a normal spider swarm, except it adds your warlock level to its hit points and the save DC for its poison. The swarm is under your mental control and fights as you direct it; commanding it is a free action. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your caster level or until it's destroyed. It can only take a standard action in the round it emerges, and you can only have one swarm in existence at a time; if you would create a second swarm, you can either choose to create the second one (the first disappears) or keep the first swarm and not create a second one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thief's bane (Cityscape): It’s hold portal, and if they manage to bypass it through knock or dispel magic the door explodes, probably not worth a lesser invocation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Void Sense: Blindsense is a good ability, but I am not sure I would use an Invocation slot on it. Good candidate for the Extra Invocation feat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Voracious Dispelling: Good Invocation. with a high spell craft, and a readied action, this Invocation could make a Warlock a good counterspeller. Note that the effectiveness decreases as your increase with level, much like the effectiveness of Dispel Magic diminishes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Walk Unseen: I love this Invocation, but I never seen to have enough slots to take it. Who doesn’t want Invisibility at will?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wall of Gloom: Not a very useful Wall Invocation, and there are much much better ones at this level you can take.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade Note: See Tleilaxu_Ghola’s comments about Wall of Gloom in the Miscellany section.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Weighty Utterance (DM): Flying foes can find their styles seriously hampered by this invocation. You can only drop foes a maximum of 40 feet (at level 20), and it can only prevent flight for a maximum of 1 round when you force an enemy to the ground, meaning that the utility of this invocation is nowhere near what it could be. Possibly consider other options.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Witchwood Step (CM): You get waterwalk and the ability to ignore undergrowth and rubble. Not bad, but not always worth the invocation slot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Greater Invocations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Caustic Mire (CM): You make an area deal acid damage and increase fire damage. Could be good in combo with brimstone blast and chilling tentacles to keep people in the mire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chilling Tentacles: Awesome, awesome Invocation! This is one of the reasons Warlocks make such good battlefield controllers! Even if someone isn’t grappled, they still take cold damage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Devil's whispers (Cityscape): Suggestion, after they perform the suggested action they must make another will save of believe it was their idea. Sounds like insidious fun to me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Devour Magic: I actually find this Invocation less useful than it's lower counterpart, since it can only be used as a targeted dispel, and as a touch spell. Flexibility is just something a Warlock can’t give up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dragonward (DM): Great if there are a lot of dragon or dragonblood creatures in your campaign. Worse than useless otherwise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enervating Shadow: A decent Invocation, but one that requires close proximity again. The Str penalty is nice, but there are better places to spend a Greater Invocation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hellspawned Grace (CM): You turn into a hellcat but lose all your normal abilities. It lasts just long enough for one battle, so it could be useful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nightmares Made Real (CM): You create an area that grants concealment and damages people who don't make the save to disbelieve, but most interestingly you can hide in plain site within the area.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Painful Slumber of the Ages (CM): You put someone to sleep until they make a save or are disturbed. If disturbed they take damage. The damage is too low to really be useful but at least it makes them a little weaker if you have to wake them yourself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tenacious Plague: A good swarm summoning spell, if that is your thing. The DC boost, and ability to treat the swarm as magical weapons for overcoming DR is pretty good. The number of swarms you summon can be pretty sick too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wall of Perilous Flame: Another good battlefield control spell, made even better since half of the damage is not fire damage anymore.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock's call: Uh. Sending isn’t that useful anyway, plus it can damage you. Sheer crap.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark Invocations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Caster's Lament (CM): You can counter spells of 7th or lower, you can also use break enchantment. Countering has potential but it gets stopped by the really powerful stuff.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dark Discorporation: Why, oh why, would you take this? You can only take move actions! Blah! It basically negates your abilities to use Invocations at all. I'd rather not. I've been informed some people prefer this Invocation. Just goes to show you cant take -1- persons opinion as fact. There are instances where Swarm Traits and Immunities will be very useful, and the damage isn’t half bad. I prefer to have access to my Invocations and Eldritch Blast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dark Foresight: Eh, I wouldn’t take it. I've never found Foresight to be all that useful. The Telepathy picks up some of the slack, and is very useful for with the Charm use.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Energy Immunity (DA): Complete Immunity to an element is nothing to snarl at. Potentially very useful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fell (Draconic) Flight, Greater (DA): 30 foot faster fly speed than afforded by the lesser invocation version plus perfect maneuverability. Potentially useful if you find yourself wanting more airspeed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Impenetrable Barrier (DM): Opaque walls of force. Great for battlefield control. Dangerous if it gets dispelled, though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Incarnum Shroud (Incarnum): Not bad, but doesn't seem to be up to the standard of other Dark Invocations. In fact, I wouldn't have been surprised to see this as a Lesser (or maybe Greater, but that's pushing it) Invocation due to the fact that this seems to be an only slightly improved version of Entropic Warding.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Instill Vulnerability (DA): Force energy vulnerability (150% Damage) on a foe (doesn't work on foes that are immune to that energy type). This can be very useful when coupled with an eldritch essence to deal energy damage. (Instill Vulnerability: Fire / Brimstone Blast)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Path of Shadow: The only long range teleportation spell a Warlock gets, and it appears you can take your party along with you. Nice ability.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Retributive Invisibility: Greater Invisibility at will, and it can damage everything around you if it is dispelled. Pretty good&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Steal Summoning (CM): You take control of a summoned creature but in addition to being narrow it requires concentration and is probably not worth it as a dark.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Word of Changing: Probably the most hilarious ability the Warlock gets, the ability to permanently Baleful Polymorph an enemy is usually too much for me to pass up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Miscellany&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Warlock Level 1 by Lilt&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I keep saying this on all warlock threads i see, and that's not just because I like to say it, but a level 1 warlock with the Summon Swarm power is GODLIKE compared to many other 1st level characters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Let's see:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spell-like ability, Standard action to cast unless stated otherwise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1d6 base damage, not much to write home about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No attack roll, Awesome when even your warrior hits less than half the time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Area effect, Hit up-to 4 targets at once, more if they're small creatures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shapeable area, form it so that it doesn't hit you or your allies meat-shields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortened duration, may seem a pain, but it prevents damage to allies meat-shields&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distraction (DC 11-12 fort save or reduced to a move action) Awesome, even fighters have a good chance to fail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the following based on swarm:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 damage a round from bleeding (Always useful, hit them with it first)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poison DC11 or Str Damage (Hit them with it once they're bleeding)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disease DC12 or Dex &amp;amp; Con Damage (Fun as a GM versus PCs!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tactics:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round One: Hit them with a swarm of bats. All the ones you hit are now dead, they just don't know it yet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Round two: Dismiss the swarm, your meat shields can probably keep them from healing themselves, or just hit the BBEG with some spiders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ok, so you'll want to swap it out once you hit 6th level as it becomes less useful, but it is an AWESOME invocation for the first 2-4 levels as it usually out-damages your Eldritch Blast, is your only area effect ability, and has other effects.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Optimizing a warlock for damage by cheezegrater&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you are going for a pure damage build, the best place to drop warlock appears to be after level 11. Before level 11, eldritch blast increases by 1d6 every other level. Past 11, it only increases every third level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rogue gains 1d6 sneak attack every other level (Why couldn't they have done this for warlocks?)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 11 / Rogue 9&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6d6 Eldritch Blast + 5d6 Sneak Attack = 11d6 damage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Add in 2d6 from Greater Chasuble = 13d6 damage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Using the Eldritch Glaive blast shape from Dragon Magic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3 attacks at 13d6 = 39d6 damage (Avg. 136.5) damage per round.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not too shabby, especially when you consider that he gets a greater essence, the ability to take 10 on UMD checks, some of the better rogue class features (evasion anyone?) and a goodly number of skill points.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm sure we could figure out how to pump the damage beyond this point, but for a simple and effective build, this makes a good starting point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dipping into Incarnate for Hellfire Warlock builds by Grave&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For 2 levels of Incarnate you can:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shape 3 soulmelds (and get 2 essentia) and bind one to the crown. Strongheart Vest is superior to Naberious (sp?) bind in that it reduces any ability damage by 1 (or more depending on invested essentia) when it occurs. Among other things, this allows you to make use of Hellfire more than once per round without worrying about accumulation of Con damage as the bind only heals 1 pt. per round irregardless of the damage taken. This is important for those builds throwing out Quickened EB's and those that want to make use of the Hellfire Shield.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This still leaves you two slots of shaping and incarnates do have a very useful list of soulmelds to choose from. For example, Planar Ward makes you immune to possession, Enchantment (charm), and Enchantment (compulsion). Personally, I think that alone is worth it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Crystal Helm gives you +2 Will v. mind-affecting (not too important), and gives a deflection bonus equal to essentia invested (remember those 2 points you get automatically). This is very nice at the lower levels when Rings of Protection are so pricey. When you bind Crystal Helm to your Crown Chakra, all your melee attacks have the force descriptor for damage. This nice against incorporeal foes with Eldritch Glaive, but the real kicker is that Crystal Helm + Eldritch Glaive + Vitriolic Blast = attack that bypasses SR and is force, so nothing has either resistance or immunity to it (in your face Flesh Golem).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Impulse Boots are great to have as they give you Uncanny Dodge.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pauldrons of Health can be useful in certain campaigns as they make a character immune to all disease and being nauseated or sickened. In addition, it offers an enhancement bonus to Fort. equal to essentia invested.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the list goes on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The best part is that you can choose which soulmelds are shaped at the start of every day and they last for as long you have them shaped which translates to a much needed increase in versatility that any Warlock build could use.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2 levels only lose you 1 point of BAB and net a +3 to Fort and Will, and while 2 + Int skills is paltry (you're a Warlock, you should be used to it), it does have Concentration, all the useful knowledge skills (such as arcana), and Spellcraft which tend to be prereq's for many Warlock available PrC's on its class list.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quite frankly, I think that's a lot for just two levels. Granted, Binders are also very versatile, but as a class to dip for Hellfire Builds, I think Incarnate is superior as it still retains its versatility without having to worry about losing the one reason you took it: the ability to negate the Con damage. For a binder, they have to stick the Naberious bind or lose their Ability Point regeneration.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;-Grave &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using Bloodlines/Legacy Champion/Uncanny Trickster to Increase Eldritch Blast Damage by Thinblade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This somewhat controversial trick doesn't work with a normal warlock, it's used in concert with Hellfire Warlock's Hellfire Blast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hellfire Warlock gains +2d6 hellfire blast every level, over the course of three levels. Bloodline levels count as a level for any level-dependent class abilities (like monk stunning fist). It has therefore been argued that 3 bloodline levels would give Hellfire Warlock a &quot;virtual&quot; boost of three levels. You wouldn't gain any other kind of ability (since Hellfire Warlockdoesn't have any past level 3), but you would continue to gain +2d6 hellfire blast for each level above 3.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other way to boost hellfire blast is through the PrC's Uncanny Trickster and Legendary Champion. Both classes advance another class's abilities, instead of just advancing spellcasting. Again, it has been argued that you could use either to boost hellfire blast &quot;through the roof&quot; by applying those virtual levels to hellfire warlock, instead of normal warlock. The advantage of this over bloodlines is that you still gain all the niceties of actual class levels (like hit points, skills, and invocations) in addition to your blast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;CustServ, it should be noted, has ruled in both directions multiple times, which really means it's down to your DM. Come up with a compelling argument and go for it. Both ways have disadvantages (losing three levels of hit points and invocations for bloodlines, and losing casting levels with the PrC's), so it's not entirely in one way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making Nightcrawler by Thinblade&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A common request on the CO boards is help in creating a D&amp;amp;D equivalent of a character from some other area of fiction. We’ve seen Final Fantasy Dragoons, Sonic the Hedgehog, a rather scary Jean Grey telekineticist, and plenty of others. Recently, I gave a lot of thought to creating a version of Nightcrawler using warlock in response to just such a request, and I figured I’d share.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock is actually a good choice to base a Nightcrawler build upon, since you can get unlimited dimension doors a day, allowing you to bamf around the battlefield at will, and the class’s flavor has the same dark feel as the inhuman-looking mutant. However, since invocations are standard actions, you’re forced to bamf, then wait until next turn to attack. Not very cool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enter the Forgotten Realms (for its last few months of existence) and the PrC ability shadow pounce: the ability to make a full attack after the conclusion of any teleportation. Now we’re talking. Alternately, you can take one level of monk and the Sun School tactical feat in Complete Warrior, but that only gives one attack after teleporting, and therefore isn’t as cool. On to shadow pouncing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of the two PrC’s that offer shadow pouncing (Crinti Shadow Marauder [Shining South] and Telflammar Shadowlord [Unapproachable East]), the Shadowlord gives it a level earlier, at 4th. Unfortunately, the entry requirements are brutal:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Non-good&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hide 10 ranks, Move Silently 10 ranks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blind-fight, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dimension Door as spell or SLA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sneak attack +2d6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ouch. Obviously, we’re going to need to multiclass, and there are two main options: thief or ninja 3 or swordsage 2. Thief gets you evasion, ninja gets you poison use and limited invisibilty, but requires a higher Wisdon. Scout, unfortunately, doesn’t get +2d6 skirmish until later.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swordsage gets sneak attack through the shadow hand stance Assassin’s Stance (so make sure you’re DM’s okay with that way of qualifying). If you split the levels of swordsage around those of warlock, you can end up getting in with just Swordsage 2.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally, if you want to get in by level 8-9, you need to play a race with a bonus feat: human, strongheart halfling, azurin, etc. Almost all of your feats will be used for Shadowlord entry requirements, and the one you have free should be Quicken SLA: Flee the Scene to get two full attacks in a turn. If you want others (two recommended are able learning and the eldritch claw feat from Dragon Magic), you’ll need to pick up some flaws from Unearthed Arcana.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So your two basic Nightcrawler bases look like this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thief 3/Warlock 6/Telflammar Shadowlord 4/X 7&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;or&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swordsage 1/Warlock 6/SS +1/TS 4/X 8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;X can be a lot of things. For this guide I’m going to assume you want to continue to advance warlock invocations. If you’re not, find some +1 BAB prestige class that looks interesting. If you are, a couple of PrC’s are interesting. Divine Oracle doesn’t give much in the way of BAB, but does have some nice defensive class features. Since you have SA dice (one way or another) and limited spellcasting from SL, you can also go into Unseen Seer, though you’ll have to use two of your three least invocations for the required divinations. The Child of Night PrC from Tome of Magic is a great atmospheric choice, advancing the shadowy nature of the character already established by the Shadowlord.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you got into TS through swordsage, you’re in the rare position of being a warlock that can enter Jade Phoenix Mage. Use your limited list of second level spells to enter, and apply the JPM advances to warlock, and bask in the fact that it’s a +1 BAB class. JPM opens up several really nice higher-level maneuvers, including a counter that teleports you when attacked (setting off shadow pouncing again), and two boosts that add fire damage to your attacks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally, if you have Tome of Battle, you should (regardless of path) pick up the maneuver shadow stride through the Martial Study feat. This allows you to shadow pounce twice in a round (three times if you quicken FtS as well). Get it at level 15 with JPM, level 18 without.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here are two versions of Nightcrawler, one using ToB, the other not. Both are assumed to be humans, without flaws.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;“Nightcrawler”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human Rogue 3/Warlock 6/Telflammar Shadowlord 4/Child of Night 7&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rogue 1: Trapfinding, SA +1d6, Dodge, Mobility&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rogue 2: Evasion&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 1: Least invocation, Blind fight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 2: Least invocation, Detect Magic&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 3: DR 1/cold iron&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 4: Darkness, Decieve Item, Spring Attack&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 5:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 6: Flee the Scene&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rogue 3: SA +2d6, Trapsense +1, Quicken: Flee the Scene&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 1: Shadowsight, shadow jump&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 2: Shadow blur&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 3: Shadow walk, Feat&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 4: Shadow pounce&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child of Night 1: Cloak of Shadows, cold resistance 5&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child of Night 2: Sustaining shadow (eat 1 meal/week), Feat&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child of Night 3: Dancing shadows 1/day&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child of Night 4: Cloak of shadows (blur 1/day) sustaining shadow (sleep 1 hour/day)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child of Night 5: Cold resistance 10, Feat&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child of Night 6: Cloak of shadows (blur 3/day), sustaining shadow (immune to poison/disease)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Child of Night 7: Dancing shadows 2/day&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BAB 13; F/R/W: 6/11/12; Casts as Warlock 12 (6d6 blast, 1 Greater invocation)“Phoenix Nightcrawler” (ToB)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human Swordsage 1/ Warlock 6/SS +1/Telflammar Shadowlord 4/JPM 8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swordsage 1: Quick to Act +1, discipline focus (weapon focus), Cloak of Deception, 5 others, Dodge, Mobility&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 1: Least invocation,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 2: Least invocation, Detect Magic, Blind fight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 3: DR 1/cold iron&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 4: Least Invocation, Decieve Item&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 5: Spring Attack&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 6: Flee the Scene&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swordsage 2: AC bonus, Assassin’s Stance, 1 maneuver (3rd)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 1: Shadowsight, shadow jump, Quicken: Flee the Scene&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 2: Shadow blur&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 3: Shadow walk&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Telflammar Shadowlord 4: Shadow pounce, Adaptive Style&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 1: +1 Man. known (4th) (Searing Blade), arcane wrath, rite of waking&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 2: Mystic phoenix stance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 3: +1 Man. known (5th) (Leaping Flame), +1 Man. readied, Shadow Stride&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 4: Empowering strike&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 5: +1 Man. known (6th) (Rallying Strike), +1 stance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 6: +1 Man. readied, Firebird stance, Jade Phoenix master, Feat&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 7: +1 Man. known (7th) (Inferno Blade)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;JPM 8: Quickening strike&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BAB 16; F/R/W: 9/11/11; Casts as Warlock 12 (6d6 blast, 1 Greater invocation)Thoughts on Tome of Battle’s influence on warlocks by Lilt&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good question, although aside from using generally overpowered abilities or counters to boost defense then I think that the answer is &quot;probably not&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlocks don't get the requirements for the only arcane casting PrC of the book, Jade Phoenix Mage, meaning that although the requirements could be grabbed with a dip into another class, it's probably not worth it. Combine this with the fact that they don't get to use the auto-quicken ability (it only works on a spell, not a spell-like), I don't think it's worth it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Maneuvers generally aren't compatible with the warlock's main source of damage, eldritch blast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some of the counters and boosts could be very useful combined with the warlock's abilities, but as most of the useful counters and boosts are higher level you're stuck with having to know useless strikes in-order to get them. Still, anyone can benefit from white raven tactics.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stances can be useful for anyone, and the +2d6 sneak attack of Assassin’s Stance could be very useful for a warlock who's able to stay invisible all the time. Available through 2 feats by level 12 or a 1-level dip into swordsage at level 9.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Generally, although it adds more options for feats, I don't think there's that much opportunity for synergy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value of becoming an apprentice: by Thinblade&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ok, let’s admit it: the d20 system forces us to plan our entire character path at the very beginning. If it didn’t, the CharOp boards wouldn’t exist (or, at least, would be very different). And one of the problems with this is you too-often run into problems getting into the prestige classes you want.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enter Apprentice, a wonderful feat from the Dungeon Master’s Guide II. It’s first-level only, but adds two skills to your class list permanently, and gives you two skill points to spend on them (check with your DM to see if you continue to gain those skill points past level 1), as well as a bonus associated with the skill.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This suddenly makes formerly hard-to-enter PrC’s much easier. Examples of mentors and the PrC’s they help with are: Entertainer (Virtuoso), Philosopher or Spellcaster (Keeper of the Cerulean Sign), and Woodsman (Cyran Avenger, Sentinal of Bharri, Swanmay).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The drawback is that you need to spend 8 hours each week with your mentor, which can make adventuring hard, and you need to tithe 100 gp to him/her each level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Once you reach level 5, though, things become more interesting. You graduate, don’t need to tithe or work with your mentor, and can turn your Apprentice feat into the Mentor feat, which gets you a 1st level apprentice you design. Your apprentice needs 8 hours of training a week, doesn’t adventure, and gains a level each time you do. When they get to level 5 (your level 10), they graduate and become a cohort. So you essentially get the Leadership feat for a 1st level feat, provided you’re willing to put in the work (pun intended) over ten levels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Itemization for a Warlock by cheezgrater&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If I don't list a sourcebook, then it is straight out of the 3.5DMG&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chasuble of Fell Power - boosts damage from your eldritch blast. Buy this. (Complete Arcane)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock's Sceptre - Gives you +2 to hit with ranged touch attacks, and by spending charges you can boost your eldritch blast damage. (Complete Arcane)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cloak of Charisma - Useful instant boost to your save DCs if you use a lot of save-based invocations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gloves of Dexterity - Useful for blaster locks and meleelocks that rely on weapon finesse.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Boots of Elvenkind - Warlocks get invisibility invocations. Move silently bonuses can't hurt for those times when sneakiness is the order of the day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mithral Full-Plate - with the Battlecaster and Medium Armor Proficiency feats, you can get a really nice AC for your warlock, with no spell failure chance. Enchant this for even better armor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Belt of Magnificence - Expensive as all get-out, but boosts all 6 stats while taking up only one slot. IIRC, it's 200,000gp for the +6 version, but +6 to every stat is really nice. (Miniatures handbook)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cloak of Displacement, Minor - all attacks against you have a 20% miss chance. Pretty nice, especially for those warlocks that like to get into melee. This can serve as a replacement for the Entropic Warding invocation (and the item is better since it also works on melee attacks), except that it doesn't make you untrackable&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pale Green Ioun Stone - +1 on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks that doesn't require an item slot? Yes, Please!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Orange Ioun Stone - +1 caster level, slotless. Won't give you extra invocations or boost Eldritch Blast damage, but can be useful if you see many enemies with spell resistance.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Manuals and Tomes - +5 inherent bonuses to Dex and Charisma are really nice for a blaster. Con is also nice for a melee lock What more needs to be said? You may also want to consider other books if you have money to burn. Beefing up stats is rarely a bad thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Horizon Goggles by FromTheShadows - I'm surprised nobody really noticed the Horizon Goggles in Complete Mage. For a mere 8,000 gp, you get extra range on your blast or invocations as long as they happen to be in a form that uses a ranged attack roll.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Codex Advocare by Tweedledope - Ya'll don't forget the Codex Advocare from the Expedition to Castle Ravenloft. It might seem minor but, for 20k it gives you an extra Least invocation known. Sure beats wastin' a feat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thoughts on Call of the Beast by Thinblade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This invocation gives wild empathy, the druid/ranger class feature, and the spell speak with animals. It’s notable because it gives a class feature and not just a spell or ability, and can therefore be used to get into PrC’s that would otherwise be unavailable. So far, the only such class in Swanmay, from the Book of Exalted Deeds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Alternate Class Features&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fiendish Flamewreath (PHB II) by Lone Wolf&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A replacement for fiendish resilience. Starting at 8th level, 1/day you can immolate yourself in wispy flames that don't hurt you or your gear, but deal 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature that strikes you with its body (I assume this means a natural weapon) or a hand-held weapon. Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Using the ability is a free action, and it lasts 2 minutes or until you take another free action to end it. The flames provide light equivalent to a torch, but can't be extinguished except by you. This is a supernatural ability. At level 13, the damage done increases to 2d6 points of fire damage. At level 18, it increases to 5d6.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Venomous Blood (Drow of the Underdark) by Lone Wolf&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This replaces your Fiendish Resilience at 8th level, and offers a +5 bonus on saves vs. poison; at 13th level, it turns your blood into a poison that affects any creature that bites you or swallows you whole (contact; Fort save DC 10 + 1/2 your warlock level + Cha modifier; 1d3 Str/1d3 Str); and finally at 18th level, allows you to envenom a weapon or your eldritch blast 3/day, with the poison dealing 1d6 Str instead of 1d3. The poison lasts until you make an attack with the weapon or eldritch blast or until the start of your next turn. Does not prevent you from applying blast shape or eldritch essence invocations to your eldritch blast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple Warlock Trick - Wall of Gloom, by Tleilaxu_Ghola:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;LoSing&quot; Enemies from Allies: Our DM made some wicked charge monsters. Nothing put the kibosh on a charging monster more than this stupid spell. Simply drop the wall in between your party member and the charging monster. The monster will be unable to target your friend, making it impossible for them to charge. To wit:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you don't have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can't charge that opponent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you cannot see the target (for instance, if you're blind or the target is invisible), you can't have line of sight to it even if you could draw an unblocked line between your space and the target's.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's also a great way to prevent casters from nuking your allies without wasting a move action. Simply sit back, and ready actions to cast another wall of gloom when they finish their move, but before they cast. Even if they move through the wall, you can set up another one in between them and they'll lose LoS, provided they don't appear adjacent to their target (most casters want a bit of space while casting to avoid AoOs).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Warlock Feats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many, many thanks to jameswilliamogle for writing this section. Additions were made by Agent Rasp, and are marked with [AR]. I've added a few feats as well, and those are marked by [TB].&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Books not in this list: Dragon Magic, Races of the Dragon, Magic of Incarnum, Sandstorm, Frostburn, Complete Psionic, Heroes of Battle, and possibly a few others (so others can jump in and continue).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Core Feats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ability Focus: Eldritch Blast: This is a great filler feat for later levels, when the Warlock gets access to Utterdark Blast in particular. Its worth taking earlier if you focus all your invocations as essences. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Apprentice [TB] (DMG II): A great feat to get into PrC’s with difficult skill requirements, Apprentice is a first-level-only feat can eventually morph into Leadership, but it requires the DM’s blessing and a lot of work (pun intended). Grants extra skill points, makes cross-class skills class skills, and grants a variety of special bonuses depending on the mentor. I’ve included a larger write-up in the Miscellany section. **/*****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Combat Casting [AR]: Some help when casting defensively, but invocations have somatic components and thus can't be attempted in a grapple anyway. High Constitution gives you at least this good a bonus, plus a nice crop of hit points and improved Fortitude, freeing up another feat in the process. Keep up your ranks in Concentration and you'll be fine. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Combat Expertise [AR]: Only really useful for melee-locks, and then only at higher levels or when multiclassed for better BAB. The Int requirement may be a slight problem, depending on how you roll or buy; personally, I'm too much of a skill freak to ever play a 2 + Int class without taking Int 14 (and usually human, too). * / *** (melee-locks)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Combat Reflexes [AR]: The advent of eldritch glaive may give some potential to this feat, especially for a melee-lock with good Dexterity; I've got a mental image of Morthos facing a line of armored bruisers and going all Tao Ren as they move in, using a repelling glaive to knock 'em flying and avoid being ground to manburgers next round. However, without Dragon Magic, I'm unclear on the mechanics of the invocation. For warlocks without glaive, the feat isn't worth it. * / ?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Empower Spell-Like Ability: I'd only take this if there was absolutely no time for crafting, as the Warlock is very tight on feats. It still can add some ok damage, though. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Flyby Attack: Your invocations and blast takes a standard action to activate, and thus Spring Attack, Shot on the Run, and Ride by Attack won't work with them. Flyby Attack allows you to make a standard action as part of a flying move action, allowing every invocation, blast, and any other standard action, and has no other feat prerequisites. You need to pick up the Fell Flight invocation, or have a flight speed by virtue of race or template (Avorial, Dragonborn, etc).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;NOTE: Some DM's won't allow you to take this feat because it isn't in the Player's Hanbook, but the Monster Manual is a core book: ask the DM if they'd allow a high level Wizard to take Craft Construct in return. They'll then counter with &quot;you don't have a fly speed all the time&quot; to which you reply &quot;its 24/7!!&quot; and then throw some Cheetos and cans of soda at him. Then find another group. I'd rate this feat higher than Precise Shot even, it's the best you can get. *****+&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes [AR]: Somewhat useful at low levels to bolster your poor Fort and Ref saves, but your Con and Dex should be above-average to high anyway, and items outstrip the feats. Dark one's own luck is a better long-term investment. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Improved Critical (eldritch blast) [AR]: Blast-oriented 'locks should take this feat ASAP (you qualify at 11th level), and others should strongly consider it. It doubles your chances to crit, it applies to all flavors and most forms of eldritch blast (except for cone, doom, and likely line), and you can use it from sunrise to sunset. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Improved Feint [AR]: With high Charisma, Bluff as a class skill, and the possibility of a bonus from beguiling influence, melee-locks trying to land a hideous blow can get some use out of this feat when facing high-Dexterity opponents. It might also be useful combined with eldritch glaive, which I gather is a melee touch attack, but touch ACs aren't usually very high to begin with, and a warlock already stands a good chance of hitting even if not optimized. Doesn't really seem worth the trouble. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Improved Initiative: This is good on every character, but unless you plan on multiclassing with Rogue or a Rogue-like class, I wouldn't waste the feat slot on it. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Improved Precise Shot:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;By the time you can take this, you could choose other feats, and your blasts are starting to lose some effectiveness. The concealment reroll ability is nicer than the cover. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Improved Sunder: Melee Warlocks could take this along with the Hammer Blast Invocation. You can do some serious sundering when you need to. The feat itself is more useful as a prelude to Combat Brute. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leadership:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It’s the most overpowered feat in the game, but even then, you might not want to take it, simply b/c it adds more complexity than you want (one optimized character is enough to handle, for me). An artificer buddy is my favorite cohort (and that’s for every non-artificer character I take). * to ******, depending on how you design the cohort.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Point Blank Shot: Mainly useful as a prerequisite for Precise Shot, it gives a +1 to hit and damage when within 30' (Complete Arcane is the source for using feats for Weapon-like effects). Without an item to increase your range, every Blast will have the added damage. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade note: It should be noted that there is a long-running and sometimes acrimonious debate regarding the usefulness of Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot, based around the fact that your blasts are touch attacks, and sooner or later you’ll probably only be missing on an auto-fail. The usefullness of these two feats varies extremely between campaigns, builds, the average touch AC of your opponents, and fighting styles. Be warned, your mileage may vary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Power Attack: You can apply the damage from Power Attack to Eldritch Glaive. That includes damage from Leap Attack, too. This is a must have for any Melee Warlock, along with Quicken SLA: Eldritch Glaive (which you use at the end of your charge). The feat is also useful as a prelude to Shocktrooper (although the feat isn’t as necessary with touch attack rolls only). ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Precise Shot: Every time you use Eldritch Blast on an enemy that doesn't die right away you'll have to fire into combat. *****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thinblade note: It should be noted that there is a long-running and sometimes acrimonious debate regarding the usefulness of Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot, based around the fact that your blasts are touch attacks, and sooner or later you’ll probably only be missing on an auto-fail. The usefullness of these two feats varies extremely between campaigns, builds, the average touch AC of your opponents, and fighting styles. Be warned, your mileage may vary.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quicken Spell-Like Ability: Can be used w/ Flee the Scene to great effect as an exit strategy, but also works well as the Teflammar Shadowlord Prestige Class Prerequisite. Also great to use with Eldritch Glaive, as it grants 2 full attacks using that invocation in a single round. Other than these specific invocations, the utility isn't quite as good. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Skill Focus: UMD: Don't take it on a Warlock; by the time you can create items, your UMD check should be high enough, and the ability to take 10 mitigates low rolls. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spell Penetration [AR]: A build with uninterrupted caster level progression can get by (especially if you take penetrating blast), but if you've taken levels in non-caster classes, consider this feat to make up some of the difference against spell resistant foes. Greater Spell Penetration might be a bit much, unless you took a big hit on caster levels or the DM favors massive SR monsters. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Weapon Focus: Ray: Generally not worth the spent feat, this might be useful as a prerequisite for other feat or Prestige Classes. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Psionic Feats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Psionic Shot:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The basis for most blast-based builds. This is the crown jewel that's used over and over in many builds. It expends your psionic focus, so you'll need to take Psionic Meditation below to be able to use it every round. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Greater Psionic Shot: Adds more damage to Psionic Shot, but since it takes up another feat slot, not quite as good. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Psionic Meditation:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Needed by most characters taking Psionic Shot to refocus as a move action. Useful only to these characters. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wild Talent:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Necessary in many builds to generate the prereq for Psionic Shot, but also can meet the prereq for Thrallherd if you want to use the sacrificial rules from BoVD to make items. Its useless to anyone else that doesn't use either of these. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mind Over Body: Only useful for Warlocks that want to take Darkspeech for turning their Summoned Swarms into Hive Minds, and only mildly useful for that (a level of Binder or becoming Undead works much better). *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Psionic Weapon, Greater Psionic Weapon:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Similar to Psionic Shot, but is only remotely useful to melee-Warlock builds. Since you have to expend your focus every time you use it, you'll never get a full round of attacks out of it (past 5th level, of course). Not worth the feat slots. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Item Creation:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Warlock gets the ability to create any item that they have the item creation feat with a UMD check. If you plan on making any items when you get the ability, its always better to take Able Learner at 1st level and dip 2 levels of Chameleon, as the 2nd level ability grants any feat you meet the prereq's for 24 hours. If you can't take Chameleon due to the campaign, then here's a quick ranking of the PHB item creation feats:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Brew Potion:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Buy them, don't make them. 1/2*&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Magic Arms And Armor:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;You can wear light armor, after all, and the tank will love you, but generally not as synergistic as the other crafting feats. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Rod:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Not good enough for a feat, but worth it if you burn through Warlock's Scepters often. *+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Staff:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;They need to hold at least 2 spells, and many DMs don't allow custom staffs. Even then the fire staff is still cheap for what it does. Add a few 0 level spells along with the real spell you want to keep the cost low for custom staffs. Staffs in general are better than Wands as you can use your Cha to boost the DC. *** without custom staffs, **** with custom staffs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Wand:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;By the time you can make them, they're losing utility. Slightly better than Craft Staff if custom staffs aren't allowed. Don't make wands for blasting for yourself: you've got Eldritch Blast. Instead, make useful utility wands. ***+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Wondrous Item:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Always decent, but many items are cheap enough to buy. ***+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Forge Ring:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Better if you can make custom rings, but usually still sucks. * with custom rings, otherwise 1/2*&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Scribe Scroll:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A good feat to have, even with Chameleon, as it allows you to scribe any spell in the game in an emergency. ****+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Construct:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A Warlock with a bunch of crafting Homonculi and Golems would make for an interesting character, but its just not worth the feat prerequisites to get this. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Contingent Spell (CArc):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Its good on normal casters, so why wouldn’t it work here? There’s nothing like having a Divine Power saved for the first time you enter combat to really kick arse. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Craft Rune Circle:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I find the Rune Circles a little expensive to make. Still, there’s some abuses for it. I rate this about equal with Craft Arms and Armor. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dual Wand Wielder (CArc):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It’s got a bad prereq for Warlocks, although they usually can meet it. You don’t want to rely this heavily on Wands. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reckless Wand Wielder (CArc), Wand Mastery (Eb):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;You don’t want to rely this much on wands. Just wait until you can make staffs instead. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Magical Artisan, Legendary Artisan, Extraordinary Artisan:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;These feats are just nominally approved on Artificers, so why would you take them? **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Feats from Lords of Madness&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aberration Banemagic [TB]: Highly campaign specific and requires DM permission since it doesn’t mention invocations, this can be an AWESOME feat if you’re fighting aberrations with anything like regularity. +2d6 damage and +2 DC with ALL invocations whenever used against aberrations. Stacks with anything else that increases damage or DC, like Vitriolic Blast (though obviously not Moralbane). Especially useful with area effects, like Chilling Tentacles. ** / ***** (depending on how often you fight aberrations)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aberration Blood [Aberrant]* [AR]: The &quot;gateway&quot; Aberrant feat. On its own, it's Skill Focus with an associated deformity, and not really much use to a warlock. Skip it unless you intend to take more Aberrant feats. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bestial Hide [Aberrant] [AR]: The fact that the natural armor bonus increases as you take more Aberrant feats is nice, but it costs too much for a warlock to find useful. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Deepspawn [Aberrant] [AR]: Yay, tentacles! But seriously, three feats for two low-damage tentacle attacks and a small grapple bonus is so-so at best; you're better off with chilling tentacles. ** / **** (if you like tentacles)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Durable Form [Aberrant] [AR]: Gaining extra hit points as you take more Aberrant feats isn't a bad deal, but Improved Toughness is worth more in the long run. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Inhuman Reach [Aberrant] [AR]: Eldritch blast and eldritch glaive are vastly better ways to reach out and touch somebody. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Inhuman Vision [Aberrant] [AR]: All-seeing eyes beats the heck out of the Spot bonus; ditto for devil's sight or see the unseen and the short-range darkvision. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Parrying Shield [AR]: No help for warlocks unless they've gained shield proficiency, but VERY useful for characters with a good shield bonus and poor touch AC. 0 for normal warlock / **** if you can use a shield&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quick Recovery [AR]: The ability to throw off stunning and dazing effects is very nice, especially since you can try to shake off effects that didn't allow a save when they occurred. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Scavenging Gullet [Aberrant] [AR]: The bonus vs ingested poisons and diseases is appropriate for the (ahem) flavor of the feat, but I've never been in a situation where it would have helped. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starspawn [Aberrant] [AR]: Limited flight, minor cold resistance, and immunity to some conditions caused by high altitude is a so-so bonus for having to give up three feats. Fell flight is better. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warped Mind [Aberrant] [AR]: The Force of Personality feat from Complete Adventurer gives you the same sort of bonus on Will saves, but more of it, and all up-front. Extra psionic power points are pointless for a warlock. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Waterspawn [Aberrant] [AR]: Swimming the Styx will give you all the benefits of this feat except for the slight cold resistance. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;* The Aberrant feats work best if you take them for thematic reasons rather than mechanical ones. Although intended to reflect a character's (distant) aberration ancestry, they could be used to show a fiendish origin instead.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feats from Heroes of Horror&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Blood Calls to Blood [AR]: This fiend-focused feat is right up the warlock's alley in terms of flavor and function; the only catch is deciding whether or not warlocks qualify as spontaneous arcane spellcasters. If you're in a fiend-heavy campaign, see if you can get the DM to fudge the prereqs a bit. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Debilitating Strike [Tainted]* [AR]: This one could be useful for a melee-lock who wants to maul good outsiders and other DR/evil opponents. The ability to damage Constitution and/or Wisdom is nice, too, but the limited uses per day could be a serious hindrance, if they apply to the entire feat and not just the ability damage. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Disease Immunity [AR]: If your DM likes biowarfare and cure disease is scarce, this feat can help you and your entire party. Taking it more than once would be overdoing it, though. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dreamtelling [AR]: This feat is useless unless the DM has introduced a &quot;dream world&quot; into the campaign. If that's the case, it's handy for dealing with the related weirdness, especially since Knowledge (the planes) is a class skill for warlocks. Not the greatest warlock feat overall, however. 0 or ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Font of Life [AR]: If energy-draining enemies are anything like common in your campaign world, take this feat. The ability to shrug off a negative level the moment you get it is godly. *****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lunatic Insight [Tainted]* [AR]: Use all Knowledge skills untrained, plus get a modest initiative bonus and a save bonus vs mind-affecting effects. Not bad. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Master of Knowledge [AR]: A flat bonus to all Knowledge checks. Not really that good unless you can use all the Knowledge skills. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pure Soul* [AR]: A nice way to avoid physical degeneration and insanity without paying for magical treatment. True, a warlock in a horror campaign should be the one most susceptible to the effects of taint, but the idea of the opposite being true -that the cleric and paladin fall prey to ever-increasing corruption and depravity while the warlock remains unaffected- is darkly amusing. *****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spirit Sense [AR]: You see dead people. Cheap movie references aside, the bonus to Spot incorporeal creatures is somewhat useful; last I checked, however, such beasties were silent unless they wanted to be heard, making Listen checks (and bonuses thereof) rather irrelevant. The short time-frame for seeing recently dead spirits seems kind of useless too. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Surge of Malevolence [Tainted]* [AR]: This is like a variant of action points, and it only gets more effective as you turn more corrupt or depraved. Too bad it's only once per day. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tainted Fury [Tainted]* [AR]: Gain extra hit points, make a smite attack, and risk Con damage at the end of the rage-like period. A warlock can find use for this feat whether he favors melee or has been dragged into it against his will, but the post-fury hp loss and Con damage is something to watch out for. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unnatural Will [AR]: Charisma modifier + Wisdom modifier on Will saves vs fear? Interesting thought, but I'd rather just take Force of Personality (again), and free up the feat that would have gone to Iron Will. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;* Pure Soul and the Tainted feats are useless if the rules for taint aren't in effect.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Feats from Complete Mage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Battlecaster Defense [Tactical] [AR]: This feat specifies the casting of spells, but could be converted for a warlock's use with no pain at all, beyond the Combat Casting requirement. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Battlecaster Offense [Tactical] [AR]: The flip side of the previous feat, just not as useful. Same caveats. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Delay Potion [AR]: The only reason I'd take this feat would be so I could walk around with a cure spell in reserve. Since warlocks can manage just as well with UMD, why bother? *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Favored Magic Foe [AR]: A little narrow, but not entirely poor. Your class skill list allows you to meet the requirements for several common enemy types. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Magic Device Attunement [AR]: Being able to activate one magical item without further UMD checks sounds nice in theory (especially since you can switch your attunement to a different item), but in practice, no warlock should be worried about failing UMD checks. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Master of Undeath [AR]: This is a great feat for a warlock with the dead walk, provided that you can find sufficiently big, powerful, and dead creatures to reanimate. Or you can animate one big bruiser and a lot of lesser troops; either way is good, and if you do things right, it's unlikely that the big guy will survive long enough to break free and eat your brains. Mmmm. Brains. 0 without the dead walk / **** with&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Feats Tome of Magic&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bind Vestige [AR]: Bind one of five vestiges and gain a minor supernatural power for up to 24 hours. Sort of like Extra Invocation, except that the powers are only interrupted by antimagic, and you can bind a different vestige each day. The powers themselves aren't much to speak of except at low levels; thematically, though, this is the sort of ability a warlock would be expected to have. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Defense Against the Supernatural [AR]: An insight bonus on saves vs supernatural special attacks. If you run into such things often, it'll help; if not, skip it. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Empower, Enlarge, Extend, and Quicken Utterance [AR]: Unless you multiclass as a truenamer, you burn far too many feats just qualifying for these. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Empower, Enlarge, Extend, and Widen Supernatural Ability [AR]: None of these are helpful to a warlock, even if he has Bind Vestige. A binder/warlock might find them useful. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Focused Lexicon [AR]: Too narrowly focused to be useful to anyone without binder levels. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Improved Bind Vestige [AR]: Opens up eight new supernatural powers you can gain by binding a vestige. They're a bit better than the previous ones. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Minor Utterance of the Evolving Mind [AR]: Choose one of four 1st-level utterances, each of which is equivalent to two spells. You have to spend 12 skill points or 6 points and a feat to get this, but some of the utterances are pretty useful. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Obscure Personal Truename [AR]: A minor benefit, useful vs enemy truenamers. The notion that your truename is somehow protected (perhaps by the pact that gives you eldritch power) is thematically appealing. Having to spend 12 skill points or 6 skill points and another feat is too rich for this, though. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Personal Truename Backlash [AR]: The effect is interesting, but minor for something you can only gain at 15th level or higher. By this point, you have better things to spend feats on. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Practiced Binder [AR]: You gain two abilities for binding a vestige. Combine with Improved Bind Vestige and you can obtain some useful abilities, but really not enough for burning three feats. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sudden Ability Focus [AR]: Once per day, you add the benefit of Ability Focus to any one special attack you have. It stacks with regular Ability Focus, and you can take it multiple times for extra uses. Nifty. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Supernatural Crusader [AR]: The offensive version of Defense Against the Supernatural. About as useful. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Supernatural Opportunist [AR]: Gain a sneak attack against threatened enemies that use a supernatural ability. You need Supernatural Crusader as a prereq. Not that helpful for a warlock. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Truename Research [AR]: The effect of this feat is too specialized to be useful for any warlock who doesn't have ranks of truenamer. 0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Truename Training [AR]: Truespeak becomes a class skill. Doesn't help warlocks at all, except to make feats with Truespeak rank prereqs easier to afford. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Utterance of the Crafted Tool, the Evolving Mind, and the Perfected Map [AR]: The utterances you can pick up from these feats are handy, but the prereqs are just too costly for a warlock. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other Feats&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Able Learner (RoD): Mainly useful as a prerequisite for Chameleon, which will give some great diversity to the Warlock. If you plan on multi-classing a lot, it’s a great feat, but otherwise just meh. I don’t consider it worth taking if you don’t plan on getting into Chameleon. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Battlecaster (CA):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Most useful to Melee Warlocks, who can use it to wear Mithril Fullplate. Usually they don’t have as many free feats for it, though. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Combat Brute (CWar):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As Shocktrooper; generally Shocktrooper is taken before this feat. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dark Speech (Hordes of the Abyss):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This feat breaks the game (Elephant Jack made this discovery). You can use it with Summon Swarm to generate a Sorcerer that can cast 6th level spells immediately, that can summon more powerful swarms to generate a chain of more and more powerful casters, all under your control (if you do it right). Expect to get chips and soda in your hair after you come to the table with this. *****+++ (broke, as in beyond Druid broke)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Defensive Archery (RotW):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A feat to give +4 AC when provoking with a ranged attack? It might be useful for a few levels when your damage is actually worth a damn, but not worth the slot in the long run. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Diving Charge (RotW):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;+2d6 damage when charging from flying. Neat for Melee Warlocks, it still would be a tight fit to put this in a standard build. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Extraordinary Spell Aim (CAdv):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Many DM’s won’t allow you to use this, as your Invocations aren’t spells. It’s a nice feat if they do allow it, as it allows you to nicely manipulate your Chilling Touch effects. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Extra Invocation (CA):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A great feat if you have room for it. Generally better to take after you have access to Greater and Dark Invocations. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Frightful Presence (Draconomicon):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A nice Cha-synergy effect for Melee Warlocks. Only works on charges, but the DC is cha based. I’d add it after a few other charging feats. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leap Attack (CAdv):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;See Power Attack above. Very useful to Melee Warlocks. ***+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Maximize Spell-like Ability (CA):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The main advantage of this feat is that it makes your Eldritch Blast easier to use in combat at higher level (you don’t have to count as many die). Not really worth the feat slot. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mobile Spellcasting (CAdv):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Don’t take this if you have access to Flyby Attack. It also specifies spells, not SLAs so you need DM fiat to make it work. You do get more movement out of this than Flyby Attack, normally, though. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mortalbane (BoVD):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;An extra 2d6 damage to anything not a Construct or Undead or Outsider, and 1/2 to them. If allowed (it’s 3.0), better than Psionic Shot simply because it doesn’t require a power point reserve, psionic focus, or a prereq feat. *****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Neraph Charge (PlH):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This is a very useful feat for Rogue / Warlocks that want to melee. Its not horrid on Melee Warlocks, as it renders the opponents you charge flat-footed. Theres worse ways to spend a feat. *+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plunging Shot (RotW):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Another +d6 damage feat if you fly. I have nothing else to say about it. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shocktrooper (CWar):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Melee Warlocks will find it useful, for obvious reasons, but not surprisingly, its not as useful as in normal melee builds since you only have to roll touch attacks. The prereq feat, Imp Bull Rush, isn’t quite that useful. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tomb-tainted Soul (LM):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;You can heal with an Utterdark Blast, but by the time you get that, its not worth taking. Just become a Necropolitan instead for the same effect. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Undead Leadership (LM):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;See Leadership above. * to *****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Epic Feats and Invocations by jameswilliamogle&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;NOTE: Epic feats are only rated with * relative to each other; obviously, any of these would be better than the non-epic feats above.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dark Transient: Teleportation and Plane Shift, improved. Not a bad feat, but there are better for an epic feat, and Shadow Walk can imitate what this feat provides, somewhat. The invocation prereq's are not unreasonable to obtain, but can almost do what the feat allows. Dedicated Arcane Spellcasters are how you travel, not the Warlock. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Sculptor: Use two eldritch blasts at double range with a +2 to hit still as a standard action, and can be combined w/ Master of Elements below. A great epic feat. Very reasonable prereq's, too. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Epic Eldritch Blast: Extra d6 damage with your blast. As everyone knows, HP expand much faster than CR. This is a feat to be taken only when you have a few of the others. *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Epic Extra Invocation: An extra Dark Invocation is great, but at Epic levels, you should have a fairly well defined invocation list. More useful to meet the prereq's for other Epic feats. ***&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Epic Fiendish Resilience: An extra fast healing 5 each time you take the feat is ok, but you still can only use it once per day. I would take this feat over Epic Eldritch Blast, but not over many of the other Epic feats. It could be useful for Melee Warlocks, if you are doing that. *+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lord of All Essences: Double essences on your blasts. Another awesome feat, particularly if you built your Warlock to really focus on essences up to that point. Eldritch Sculptor is still better, but in certain builds this could be just as good. Easy Prereq's. ***+1/2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Master of the Elements: Summoning is cool, and dominating elementals is cool, and extra energy resistance is cool, but I just don't think its as good as a few of the other feats. It makes for a nice filler feat, but I wouldn't take it unless you already had the 2 cruddy invocation prereq's. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Morpheme Savant: You get Tongues, a monster bonus from Beguiling Influence, and can use a Suggestion if you know the creature you are suggesting, and over any plane, with no limit on the amount of times you can use it (as normal) with reduced activation time. Think about it: every non-deific creature will roll a 1 eventually. Keep suggesting to that Efreeti the Wizard just gated that it grants you 3 wishes until it does. The last ability is worth it. You really only have to take 1 crappy invocation to get this. ****&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Paragon Visionary: Its like permanent True Sight, but better. The invocations required aren't horrid, but the overall package is a little weak for Epic. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shadowmaster: This is the OMG feat in epic. Its like gaining every 8th level and lower Conjuration spell as its own invocation. All the required Invocations are weak, but this feat makes up for it completely. *****+&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Souleater Incarnate: Combine with a bag of rats, and then animate them, and you can get ridiculous +X to saves and attacks. Since it seems the Incarnum invocations aren't that good, however, I'd say pass on this one except for in a few builds that actually are focused on Incarnum. Melee Warlocks may be able to get some really nice advantages out of this one, though. **&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Verminlord: You take Darkspeech (Hordes of the Abyss) and then focus on getting this feat. Dominate Monster (Vermin), makes your swarms pass up a little more DR (but not Epic DR), and increases the poison save for centipedes (which normal Warlocks can't usually get). Reasonable prereq invocations, too. Definitely not as powerful as Shadowmaster, All Essences, Morpheme, or Sculptor. ***&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;CONCLUSIONS: Get Shadowmaster, Morpheme Savant, Eldritch Sculptor, and Lord of All Essences, in that order of importance. Avoid Epic Fiendish Resilience and Epic Eldritch Blast. Take Epic Extra Invocation to meet the prereq's you don't have for Shadowmaster or Morpheme.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic Builds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This isn’t every build here on the boards, but it feels like it . I’ve liberally used spoiler blocks in an attempt to keep this thread at least a little managealbe. I’ve also split what used to be one post into two, to avoid posting limits. This first post are more basic builds, with advanced builds and those requiring somewhat questionable tricks following in the second post. - - Thinblade&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Basic Human Warlock 20 (EB Focused) by Tealgorthian&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 1: Point Blank Shot, (Precise Shot)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 3: Ability Focus (Eldritch Blast)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 6: Spell Penetration&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 9: Maximize Spell-like Ability (Eldritch Blast)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock12: Sudden Still&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock15: Greater Spell Penetration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock18: Extra Invocation&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Least Invocations ( ---&amp;gt; denotes a switch in Invocations, if there is no note for when, assume ASAP)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spiderwalk ---&amp;gt; See the Unseen (When you get Fell Flight)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sickening Blast ---&amp;gt; Beguiling Influance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Entropic Warding&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lesser Invocations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Chain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beshadowed Blast ---&amp;gt; Voracious Dispelling&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fell Flight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Greater Invocations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vitriolic Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Noxious Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chilling Tentacles&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Cone (Through Extra Invocation)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dark Invocations&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Utterdark Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Doom&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Path of Shadows&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Versatile Warlock - Invocations yet to be decided.

Some people go for rogue 3 for evasion and more skills and also take the 6th level in shadowlord for the death attack, but I think this build is more exact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The invocations I would take are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Least: Hideous Blow, See the Unseen, Baleful Utterance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lesser: Flee the Scene, Walk Unseen, Fell Flight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Greater: Devour Magic, Vitriolic Blast&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am avoiding blast shapes mostly because this is a melee build. I've actually considered enervating shadow, but I just don't think it's worth if, even for a melee build that moves around constantly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Various Builds from Mommy was an Orc&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I like the following Warlock builds:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rogue 1/Warlock 12/Daggerspell Mage 7 - +3d6 Sneak, 18th level Warlock, still gets Imbue Item. Very effective with Chain and retributive invis. With Able Learner, can be a solid party Rogue, too.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rogue 2/Fighter 2/Warlock 4/Daggerspell Mage 8/Nightsong Enforcer 4 - +5d6 Sneak, +16 BAB, 11th level Warlock.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hexblade 2/Warlock 18 - +11 to all saves vs spells at high level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 16/Green Star Adept - basically gets 4 DR/--&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Warlock Theme Builds by Scrollreader&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've been playing around with the Warlock, and found (I think) some very nice and interesting PrCs for them, and some nifty combinations. Each of theme is themed for a certain role, and is, IMO, decently, if not expertly optimized. Lemme know what you think, especially ways to tweak them further.

The Eeeeeeevil Warlock. Tons of nifty spell like abilities that add some flexibility to the Warlock invocations. Nice social skills.

Half of which is Vile. Ow.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh.

I've stirred in a bit of incarnum, but I'm sure you could do just as well without it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some notes: The clerical casting is most assuredly the sideline for this character; this is a warlock first and a cleric second.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 1 Warlock 1 {Eldritch Spear} [Point Blank Shot, Far Shot]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 2 Cleric 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 3 Warlock 2 {Miasmic Cloud} [Precise Shot]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 4 Cleric 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 5 Warlock 3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 6 Cleric 3 [Incarnum Spellshaping]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 7 Eldritch Disciple 1 {Devil's Sight} (Healing Blast)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 8 Eldritch Disciple 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 9 Enlightened Soul 1 [Healing Soul]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 10 Eldritch Disciple 3 {Witchwood Step}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 11 Eldritch Disciple 4&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 12 Eldritch Disciple 5 {Voracious Dispelling} (Wild Frenzy) [Divine Soultouch]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 13 Enlightened Soul 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 14 Enlightened Soul 3 {Celestial Flight}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 15 Enlightened Soul 4 [Extra Turning]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 16 Enlightened Soul 5 {Eldritch Glaive}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 17 Enlightened Soul 6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 18 Enlightened Soul 7 {Holy Blast} [Divine Justice]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 19 Eldritch Disciple 6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Level 20 Eldritch Disciple 7 {Crawling Eye} (Fearful Glare)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pros: cleric spells, nice abilities from PrCs (aura of courage, aura of menace, holy blast, healing blast) BAB of 14, Saves are quite solid for will (+16) and Fortitude (+11), Eldritch Blast of 8d6 (only 1d6 less than a warlock 20)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cons: Stunted access to invocations (least and lesser only), bad reflex save (+4), no decieve item feature.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Further notes: My kingdom for just ONE greater invocation! Getting Incarnum Blast in there would be fantastic for this build.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Scar Enforcer Builds by surreal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Half-Elf ranger 1/warlock6/scar enforcer 10/Eldeen Ranger 4(Greensinger)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- would like to fit in half-elf bard sub 1 somewhere&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- get cha to saves, 1 greater invocation, sneaky ranger-ish, smites, sneak attack, hide in plain sight, disguise self&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Half-elf ranger 1/warlock 4/scar enforcer 8/master of the yuirwood 4/corrupt avenger 3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- get BAB 16, saves 12/7/12 + cha, 1 greater invocation, smite 3/day and tainted strike 1/day, sneak 2d6, disguise self, HiPS,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- favoured enemy (human &amp;amp; elf) and sworn foe, good skills (102 + 23*Int), uncanny dodge, pass without trace, 2nd level arcane spells&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- play style is fairly open... probably more suited to the social role&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Half-elf ranger 1/warlock 2/swordsage 2*/scar enforcer 8/shadow sun ninja 4/xyz 3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;*unarmed strike variant&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advanced Builds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Doom Machine by Aurelius&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warforged Warlock 1/Fighter 2/Warlock 2-4/Dragonslayer 3/Doomlord 10/Occult Slayer 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BAB 19, Saves 11/5/12+2 (+1 against spells and spell-like abilities). Warlock caster level 11. Average d10 hit die. Mithral Body.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A lot of your feats are tied up here, and you get only 1 greater invocation, but there are hidden perks. If you have a use magic device score of 10 (which you should be able to get, you can automatically succeed in activating wands. Warforged don't need free hands to activate wands thanks to the Wand Sheath component (EbCS). Now get a Wand of Wraithstrike and and power attack away with your big sword. You also get 3 +20 damage smites per day. A Wand of Repair damage is also recommended. If you take the acid blast essence thing for your greater invocation, you don't need to worry about SR, and it fits the theme like a glove. You can replace the Occult Slayer level with something else if you like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Warlock Avenger by TacticsPlanner&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I like the idea of a Human Psychic Warrior 1/Warlock 12/ Chameleon 2/Cyran Avenger 5 with the typical blasting feats using the Chameleon feat for item creation and adapting to the adventure using things like Extra Invocation and the myriad of feats too specific to take normally.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;The 5d6 Avenging Strike to ranged attacks (yay for weapon-like spell-like abilities!) Cha Mod times/day is awesome. All you need to do is wait for someone in your party to get hp damaged to use it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You could also swap out the Psychic Warrior level for Fighter (16 bab), Rogue, Changeling Rogue, Mindbender, or anything else your party needs to help this fit in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Eldritch TheUr-Lock by NatchFeral&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 9/Ur-Priest 2/Eldritch Disciple 9&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Abilities:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Invocations as Warlock 18 (2 Dark Invocations)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric Spells as Ur-Priest 10 (9th level cleric spells)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rebuke Undead&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BAB +13&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Saves: +6/+6/+15&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Variant: Warlock 8/Ur-Priest 2/Eldritch Disciple 8/Chameleon 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Abilities:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Invocations as Warlock 16 (1 Dark Invocation)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric Spells as Ur-Priest 10 (9th level cleric spells)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rebuke Undead&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BAB +14&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mystic Wanderer (MoF) is a nice 2 level dip, as well. Cha as a sacred/profane bonus to AC, plus a familiar.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tricks:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Use Miracle to dupe Body Outside Body, Use Divine Metamagic Persistant Spell and a rod of Extend Spell to make it last 48 hours. Boosting caster level will get you 4-5 clones. All can use the Warlock Invocations. Multiple uses of Miracle can get you up to 30 clones. The Chameleon floating feat can allow the clones to customize themselves with Extra Invocation. Astral Projection can net lots of duplicate equipment for your clones to use.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Make any magic item in the game aside from golems (Variant Build)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tricklock by leif008&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I figured out one easy way for a Rogue/Warlock to meet the requirements for the Arcane Trickster Prc since it only requires the ability to cast 2 spells which can be met by spell-like abilities (pg 72 Carc). Mage hand is gained from the Spell hand feat, and the ability to cast Daylight gained from the Aasimar race which is a 3rd level arcane spell.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aasimar +2 Cha, +2 Wis&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The build is a ranged Aasimar warlock using sneak attack. I've listed the build with the +1 ECL paid off. The way to ultimately munchkin out the character is to add the Dark Creature Template, so he gains +10 movement speed, 10 cold resistance, and the coveted Hide in Plain Sight ability. Surprise round Sneak Attack Eldritch Blast, next turn: Move + hide in plain sight, fire off a Sneak Attack Eldritch Blast, etc. If you wind up using the Dark Creature Template switch out Walk Unseen, Miasmic Cloud, Retributive Invisibility, and Nightmares Made Real for invocations that aren't redundant in purpose.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My group always plays with bonus feats gained every odd level but we don't play with flaws. So if you play with the standard feat progression remove some extra invocations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[01] Rogue 1 [Craven] - Sneak Attack 1d6, Trapfinding&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[02] Warlock 1 - Eldritch Blast 1d6, Least: Miasmic Cloud&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[03] Warlock 2 [Precise Shot] - Detect Magic, Least: Dark One's Luck&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[04] Rogue 2 - Evasion&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[05] Warlock 3 [Practiced Spellcaster] - Eldritch Blast 2d6, DR 1/Cold Iron&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[06] Rogue 3 - Sneak Attack 2d6, Trap Sense +1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[07] Arcane Trickster 1 [Spell Hand] - Ranged Legerdemain 1/day, Least: Eldritch Spear&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[08] Arcane Trickster 2 - Sneak Attack 3d6, Eldritch Blast 3d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[09] Arcane Trickster 3 [Maximize SLA] - Impromptu Sneak Attack 1/day, Lesser: Fell Flight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[10] Arcane Trickster 4 - Sneak Attack 4d6, Eldritch Blast 4d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[11] Arcane Trickster 5 [Empower SLA] - Lesser: Walk Unseen, switch Miasmic Cloud to Baleful Utterance, Ranged Legerdemain 2/day&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[12] Arcane Trickster 6 - Sneak Attack 5d6, Eldritch Blast 5d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[13] Arcane Trickster 7 [Quicken SLA] - Impromptu Sneak Attack 2/day, Lesser: Eldritch Chain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[14] Arcane Trickster 8 - Sneak Attack 6d6, Eldritch Blast 6d6, Greater: Nightmares Made Real, Switch out Walk Unseen for Flee the Scene&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[15] Arcane Trickster 9 [Extra Invocation: Least or Lesser] - Ranged Legerdemain 3/day&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[16] Arcane Trickster 10 - Sneak Attack 7d6, Greater: Vitriolic Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[17] Warlock 4 [Extra Invocation: Least or Lesser] - Deceive Item, Eldritch Blast 7d6, Greater: Vitriolic Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[18] Rogue 4 - Uncanny Dodge&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[19] Warlock 5 [Extra Invocation: Least or Lesser] - Greater: Eldritch Cone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[20] Warlock 6 - Dark: Retributive Invisibility&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Oz the Singing Warlock by NatchFeral&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Okay, here is an Eldritch Theurge build, since I've had so much fun with the Eldritch Disciple...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Build&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bard 1 (Precocious Apprentice, Sanctum Spell)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Theurge 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sublime Chord 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Theurge 2-10&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Benefits:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9th level sublime chord spells&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Invocations as Warlock 18&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Able to cast all spells in light armor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DR 4/cold iron&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fiendish Resiliance 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spellblast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Greatreach Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Variations:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock levels 5-8 could be any prestige class that advances warlock casting, so Mindbender, Blood Magus, etc. could be added. Chameleon 2 would still allow for a single Dark Invocation. Binder 1 could substitute for a Warlock level, then Anima Mage at level 3, provided Improved Binding is taken as the level 3 feat. Use Anima Mage 6 to replace the remaining Warlock levels, advancing both Warlock Invocations and Binding. That gives access to 4th level vestiges.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tricks:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nothing special, aside from the easy entry into Sublime Chord.

Next round, 5' step into them, and use a Hideous Blow shape /Greater Spellreach essence Eldritch Blast, doing:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8d6 Eldritch Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4d6 Psionic Weapon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12d6 Scorching Ray (stored)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;20d6 Polar Ray (channeled)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;20d6 Polar Ray (Greater Spellreach)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Weapon damage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Or, 64d6 + weapon damage. All but 12d6 is subject to SR, sadly. However, this is only a first swing at the idea. Other spells could work also.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Abjurant Champion build by PonTelon&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dunno if this has been pointed out yet, but for a level 15 game I'm going to run:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Battle Sorc 1/ Warlock 6/Abjurant Champion 5/ Dragonslayer 3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BAB: 13&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock: 14&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sorc: 1(CL=BAB)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Basically the Sorc is there to qualify and provide Mage Armor/Shield to beef up AC. This is going melee focused taking the Lesser Invocation: Eldritch Glaive from Dragon Magic. Invocations I'm looking at are:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Blast: 7d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invocations:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Least: 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eldritch Glaive (DM)melee touch, can get full attack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See the Unseen(CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baleful Utterance(CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lesser: 3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deteriorating Blast(level 4)(DM)- Fort or -5 DR 1 min&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relentless Dispelling(4)(DM)- Dispell magic 2r&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flee the Scene (CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fell Flight(CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hellspawned Grace(CM)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wall of Perilous Flame(CA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So I have: 13/8/3 Eldritch Glaive(7d6) without stats or anything else added in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;No idea what you should take for the last few levels..perhaps finishing out Dragonslayer for the BAB and +arcane (applied to warlock of course)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Warlock Daggerspell Mage Build by Mommy was an Orc&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human Rogue 2/Fighter 1/Warlock 4/Daggerspell Mage 8/Nightsong Enforcer 4/Master Thrower 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;28 point buy: Str 10, Dex 16, Con 14, Int 14, Wis 10, Cha 8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;+16 BAB, +5d6 Sneak&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Saves of 6/16/11&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1: Rogue 1: Able Learner, TWF, +1d6 Sneak&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2: Warlock 1: Eldritch Blast 1d6, Invocation: Sickening Blast&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3: Fighter 1: Practiced Spellcaster, Point Blank Shot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4: Warlock 2: Dex 17: Invocation: See the Unseen&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5: Warlock 3: Eldritch Blast 2d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6: Warlock 4: WF: Dagger, Invocation: Beguiling Influence&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7: Daggerspell Mage 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8: Daggerspell Mage 2: Dex 18: Eldritch Blast 3d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9: Daggerspell Mage 3: Precise Shot, +2d6 Sneak: Invocation: Eldritch Chain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10: Daggerspell Mage 4: Eldritch Blast 4d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;11: Daggerspell Mage 5: Invocation: Walk Unseen&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12: Daggerspell Mage 6: Improved Initiative, +3d6 Sneak: Dex 19: Eldritch Blast 5d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;13: Daggerspell Mage 7: Invocation: Fell Flight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;14: Daggerspell Mage 8: Invocation: Vitriolic Blast - Sickening Blast -&amp;gt; Entropic Warding: Eldritch Blast 6d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;15: Rogue 2: Extra Invocation: Lesser: Flee the Scene&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;16: Nightsong Enforcer 1: +4d6 Sneak: Dex 20&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;17: Master Thrower 1: Quick Draw, Trip Shot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;18: Nightsong Enforcer 2: Extra Invocation: Lesser: Void Sense&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;19: Fighter 2: Improved Precise Shot&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;20: Rogue 3: +5d6 Sneak: Dex 21&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Notes:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8 Charisma - except for the Sickening Blast, there's really nothing which relies on DC at all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At 20th level, does a 6d6 Eldritch Blast - by being in a Sneak Attack situation, does 15d6+1(6d6+4d6 extra+5d6 Sneak+1) with the primary target. 10d6+1(3d6+2d6 extra+5d6 Sneak+1) damage to the secondary ones.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In situations where there's 1 target, uses thrown daggers or a bow to generate lots of sneak attacks as a +16 BAB, 5d6 Sneak character with a very high dexterity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is possible to replace the 1 Fighter level and Master Thrower 1 with 2 levels of Rogue - the problem for me in doing that is significantly delaying Precise Shot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Has 120 Skill Points as a base, 189 once you include human+14 Int.

This would be a nasty combo even though damage was reduced. Charge w/massive damage, and then dimension-door out of the range in the same round).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you pump up your Charisma as well as Strength, Repelling Blast could make this even nastier (Charge with damage, Reflex save or victim is blown backwards and knocked prone).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So when you start grabbing buffs, you could dish out some severe damage with a meleelock!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Warlock/Wizard/Cleric by LiamDeclan&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(End result is a cleric of 7/ Wizard of 11/ Warlock of 18)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To get the most out of what you want you can try this little trick.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Take the Illumian race from Races of Destiny, choose the krau sigil as one of your racial abilities.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Start off with this Cleric 1/Wizard 1/Warlock 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now for feats at first level take the Improved Power Sigil Krau feat (also in Races of Destiny) this feat allows you to choose any 2 spells and from that point on they are cast at 1 spell level higher than their actual level. You can change the spells selected at anytime you gain new spells. So when you gain that wizard level choose 1 of the arcane spells along with 1 of your divine spells. Now you can cast 2nd level arcane and divine spells.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Okay now we have 3 character levels and the ability to cast 2nd level arcaneine spells getting you into Mystic Theurge.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Further your character progression by doing this:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric 1/Wizard 1/Warlock 1/Mystic Theurge 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Use the mystic to up your Cleric and Warlock levels.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now you further the progression by going into Eldritch Theurge and Eldritch Disciple&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cleric 1/Wizard 1/Warlock 1/Mystic 2/Eldritch Theurge 10/Eldritch Disciple 5&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So end result is a cleric of 7/ Wizard of 11/ Warlock of 18&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can do the same with Sorcerer and you would have a Sorcerer of 10 losing that 6th level spell that a Wizard would have had.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Vituoso by Vainglory&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human Paragon 3/Warlock 7/Virtoso 10&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gives 2 dark invocations, 8d6 blast, +2 Charisma and lots of bard song goodies. The bonus feat is a godsend as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Fey Heritage feats from Complete Mage may not be a power gamer's delight but they aren't awful if you get stuck playing a lot of low character level games they can be quite nice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fey Heritage, nothing special, prereq for others.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fey Legacy, 9th level, confusion, summon nature ally V, dimension door once a day. Full range dimension door, and you may not have flee the scene at this point.

Deep Slumber and Disguise have a lot of uses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fey Skin, basically 1/cold iron DR per feat here that explicitily stacks with the warlock ability. 4 of these feats by level 7 would give you 6/cold iron DR...not bad for the level.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Hellfire Champion by Grave&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 6/Anarch 2 (variant Paladin)/Mindbender 1/Hellfire Warlock 3/Legacy Champion 8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock lvl: 16&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;+7d6 Eldritch Damage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;+18d6 Hellfire.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As has been pointed out, using Shape Soulmeld (Strongheart Vest) negates the one downside to Hellfire use (aside from those that arise from rp -- pitch wielding mobs--ahem). Another 2 feats to pick up are Mindsight (gotta love Telepathy) and Mortalbane (this one actually fits flavor-wise). The inclusion of Anarch was mainly for Cha to saves (and as an upside, I think can be easily made to fit flavor-wise). Granted, this build hinges on allowing Legacy Champion to further progress Hellfire Warlock, which I think it would as it only increase class features and effective level (but not actual level so epic need not apply). Sure, the Legacy Champion is rather subpar, but in this instance, even with all its useless legacy abilities the fact that it provides a net damage increase of +18d6 untyped and furthers Warlock invocations and EB makes it worth it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I get some time, I'll post a full build, and also report on it's playability (new 12th campaign starting soon).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;-Grave &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Grave note: Anarch is from Dragon #310. It's full of variant paladin classes for every alignment type. My DM generally allows them all as it does make sense that the other alignments would have some form of champion. If that doesn't fly, you could always drop the Mindbender level and use the Paladin of Freedom variant for Divine Grace. Course, this assumes you want to be good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As for Legacy Champion, if you don't want to eat the usually high penalties associated with your legacy item, you can always just ignore it and not unlock squat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Paragnostic Eldritch Disciple by carnivore&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gray Elf&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chaotic Good&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Patron: Ehlonna&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warlock 2/ Cloistered Cleric(spontaneous Domain caster variant: Healing) 3/ Eldritch Disciple 10/ Paragnostic Apostle 4/ Contemplative 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Domains:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Healing:.cast any Healing Domain spell Spontaneously&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Celerity: gives Time Stop, Greater Blink, Haste&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Animal: gives Shapechange&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Knowledge: lots of info gathering power&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spell Casting:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Caster level 17th(20th with Practiced Caster)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9th level Divine Spells&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Turn Undead:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Base Turn Undead(without items):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;as 17th lvl Cleric +2(paragnostic apostle:See thru the Veil)= 19th lvl Cleric&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12th lvl Warlock:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Invocations:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Least:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Spear.........250' range EB&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Beguiling Influence....+6 Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All Seeing Eyes.........+6 Search, Spot, and Continuous Comprehend Languages&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lesser:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eldritch Chain.........3 targets&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Voracious Dispelling..Dispel Magic and Damage target&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fell Flight................24 hour Flight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Greater:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Chilling Tentacles.......Evards Tentacles with Cold damage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What makes this fun and powerful: the Class Ability: Gift of the Divine.

The formatting has also been revised so the guide flows better.-SoloWarlock Information Compilation by ThinbladeI’m a big fan of the warlock, but lately I’ve been growing more and more frustrated with how scattered optimization information is for it across the CO Board. A lot of good things have been posted, and many have either vanished or are buried in the very large Warlock Handbook thread. I’ve been especially annoyed that there isn’t a single list with all published invocations and their commentaries.Now, I’m not the best optimizer, but I can collate with the best of them. And I happen to be working on a large research paper, from which I need to take breaks. So I’ve decided to put together a single document, built around Tealgorthian’s original Warlock Handbook, that distills our commentaries on everything that’s been published since Complete Arcane.Much of what follows is not my work. Every comment and build is taken verbatim (though occasionally I’ve done a little copy editing) and is attributed to the original poster. The sole exception is the Invocation Critiques section, where posters are attributed at the top and the invocations are grouped by strength and type (essence, shape, or normal).Table of ContentsThinblade’s Compilation IntroductionWarlock Handbook Introduction by TealgorthianThe Two Most Important Questions by ThinbladeRacesPrestige ClassesInvocation GuideMiscellany&amp;nbsp;Warlock Level 1Optimizing Warlock Damage with Sneak AttackDipping Incarnate for Hellfire WarlockUsing Bloodlines/Legacy Champion/Uncanny Trickster to Increase Eldritch Blast DamageMaking Nightcrawler (Shadowpounce builds)Tome of Battle’s Influence on WarlocksApprentice Feats and their ValueBasic Warlock ItemsCall of the Beast InvocationAlternate Class FeaturesSimple Warlock Trick – Wall of GloomWarlock FeatsEpic Warlock Feats and InvocationsBasic BuildsAdvanced BuildsWarlock Handbook Introduction by TealgorthianThere's been a rash in Warlock threads here recently.

Good Invocations for this are: Beguiling Influence, Leaps and Bounds, Entropic Warding, See and Unseen, and Spiderwalk, depending on what you are trying to accomplish. A social Rogue, for example, could pick up a +6 unnamed bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate. A warrior could dip in for 1 level to get See the Unseen, which would grant Darkvision and See Invisibility.Dipping for a second level gets you Detect Magic at will, and a second Invocation.The max I would go for a dip into Warlock is 4, which nets you 3 Least Invocations, Detect Magic at will, Eldritch Blast 2d6 (Meh) Damage Reduction 1/Cold Iron, and Imbue Item, which gives you the awesome ability to take 10 on UMB checks, something shared only by the Artificer.The Two Most Important Questions When Building Warlocks: by ThinbladeIntroductionLately, I’ve found myself typing more or less the same thing over and over again for beginners wanting to know how to build a warlock. Since it’s a popular topic, I decided to write down my thoughts in a more coherent manner, the better to help those in need.At the heart of any warlock build are two questions: melee or ranged, and Charisma or no Charisma.Melee vs. RangedMost warlocks want to be in melee combat about as much as your average wizard does: namely, they don’t want it the least little bit. While your slightly better hitpoints (d6), and the ability to wear light armor help, no one would ever confuse a warlock with a fighter. Coupled with a lack of martial weapon proficiency and good combat-boosting buffs (magic weapon, divine power, et. al), one would think no warlock in their right mind would want to get into melee.Prior to the release of Dragon Magic, you would be correct. Hideous Blow, previously the only melee invocation, indeed blows hideously. It requires a normal melee attack to hit, can be disrupted like any other invocation, and only gives one attack. No one in their right might took it. However, with Complete Mage came Eldritch Glaive, and a whole new world opened.Eldritch Glaive is everything Hideous Blow should have been. It’s a touch attack, gives reach, and allows you to make iterative attacks. It has downsides as well (namely you can’t move while you do it and you can’t get extra attacks from things like haste), but it finally made warlocks viable in melee combat.One of the first two choices you have to make is whether you want to aim at becoming what JanusJones calls a “glaivelock,” or whether you want to focus on ranged combat only. Note that while a glaivelock does not have to glaive all the time, many of your feats, invocations, and likely also levels in other classes will focus on one area, and not the other. Your stats will likely follow suit as you try to get prereqs for combat feats and make sure you can be effective in close combat. This is why you’ll want to make this choice at character creation, even though a pure (or mostly pure) warlock probably won’t be getting eldritch glaive until you swap another invocation for it a level 6.Either kind of character is completely viable, so make your choice based on what you want to play, and what other characters are in your group. If you’re interested in glaivelocks, I cannot recommend enough JanusJones’s guide.Charisma vs. No CharismaA lot of people new to the warlock are under the impression that, just because the class description says that a high charisma is important to warlocks, that they need a high charisma. The truth is more complex: there are actually two kinds of warlock invocations: those that need charisma, and those that don’t. It is entirely possible to make a viable warlock and dump charisma, you just need to decide what you want your character to focus on.Have a high charisma if you:Want to use a lot of eldritch essences (Noxious Blast, Repelling Blast, Utterdark Blast)Want to use invocations that require a save (Tenacious Plague, Word of Changing, Nightmares Made Real)Want to get a saving throw bonus through Dark One’s Own LuckWant to be a party face using beguiling influence, and need all the help you can getDump charisma if you:Are focusing on 24 hour buffs (Fell Flight, all the +6 to skills invocations, Dark Foresight, Walk Unseen, Entropic Warding)Are using invocations that do not require a save (Chilling Tentacles, Path of Shadows, Flee the Scene, Hellspawned Grace)As you can see, a lot of the best invocations (Fell Flight, Flee the Scene, Chilling Tentacles, Walk Unseen) do not require charisma to be effective. Equally, a lot of the invocations that require saves are less than useful (Stony Grasp, Bewitching Blast, and Frightful Blast are all low-lights) The best save-requiring invocation is, far and away, Utterdark Blast. If you’re making it that far, UB by itself makes having a high charisma worth it. At lower levels, the choice is less clear-cut. Also, if you’re playing a good-aligned warlock, you might have some qualms throwing around negative energy at will.ConclusionI hope this discussion has cleared up what in my mind are the two primary questions a player must answer when designing a warlock. Everything else flows from the answer to melee vs ranged and charisma vs no charisma. Once you’ve decided, your statistics, your feats, your invocations, and everything else begins to become clear.RacesPlayer’s Handbook RacesHalfling by OogarI am starting to see Halfling as a nice choice for Warlock race. Small size and a +2 dex basically adds a net of +2 to hit with the Eldritch Blasts and +2 AC. The Save bonus is nice and if you are in Forgotten Realms you can snag the extra feat with the one subrace (If you need the feat).&amp;nbsp;While you end up low in skill points, I expect that if you spend much time on this board, you will likely be spending your skill points in very specific ways anyhow. The loss of strength and weapon size do not really hinder too greatly, and use of Fell Flight or Flee the Scene can assist in the loss of movement speed.&amp;nbsp;For flavor it is rather easy for me to see a halfling that had an ancestor that tried to pull a fast one on an arch devil, or some big mucky muck from the abyss, and ended up passing along this little legacy to our little hero (anti-hero).Human by ThinbladeHumans are always a viable option. Many warlock builds are feat starved, and, while they have a good list of skills, they lack skill points. Human helps with both of these. Human is also the only race (besides doppelganger) that can get Able Learner and become a Chameleon.Other RacesHellbred (Fiendish Codex II) by DastardlyDan:+2 racial bonus to IntimidateEvil Exception: Good-aligned Hellbred can use Evil-aligned items without penalty.Devil's Favor: Bonus feat (+2 bonus on any roll 1/day)Automatic Language: Infernal (Qualifier for Hellfire Warlock PrC)Infernal Aspect: Choose Body or SpiritBody:&amp;nbsp;1st Clvl: +4 save vs. poison, +2 Con, -2 Int4th Clvl: Bonus Devil-Touched Feat14th Clvl: Bonus Devil-Touched FeatSpirit:1st Clvl: 30' Darkvision, +2 Sense Motive, +2 Cha, -2 Con6th Clvl: 60' Darkvision9th Clvl: 120' Darkvision12th Clvl: Can see in any darkness, including magical as strong as Deeper Darkness spell15th Clvl: Telepathy to 100'Hengeyokai – Crane, Sparrow (Oriental Adventures) by Thinblade:The chaotic good animal shapechangers from Oriental Adventures make good fey-themed warlocks. In their hybrid form they gain a +2 Dex as well as a fly speed, freeing up one of the valuable lesser invocation spots for something other than Fell Flight. You can also use your invocations while in your animal form. (How do you know which of those flocking sparrows is the warlock? It’s the one throwing eldritch blasts at you.)Note that the 3.5 update in Dragon 318 removed their +1 LA by making them Humanoid (shapechangers). This makes them much more attractive.Jaebrin (Monster Manual 5) by Richmud and HelloRaptor[by Richmud]I've been looking at the Jaebrins from MM5 which have several interesting features that may prove useful for a warlockThe get a charisma bonus, a bonus to bluff and diplomacy both handy for a warlock, a luck bonus to AC, immunity to enchantments and the ability to fake being enchanted which are just all around handy. Most interestingly they have a bite attack that can lower will saves. I can see it being quite good for a warlock as they can be capable enough in combat to bite a foe before unleashing something that requires a will save (charm always being a good option)[by HelloRaptor]Stats: -2 Str, +2 Cha (add the Magic Blooded template for a nice -2 Str, -2 Wis, +2 Cha)Misc Bonuses: +1 Luck to AC, Enchantment spells cast at +1 DC, +2 on Appraise, Bluff, Perform and Diplomacy checks.Natural Attack: Bite. Also acts as a special attack 'Will Sapper', any creature struck by it must make a DC (10+ConModifier+1/2 Class Levels) Will Save or suffer a -4 to Will saves for the next 10 rounds.Absorb Enchantment: Not only are Jaebrin immune to Enchantment spells and effects, they automatically know when they're Enchanted and what the intended effect is, and can feign being under its effect. Others have to beat them with Sense Motive vs a Bluff check to know they're faking.All they have going against them is a Level Adjustment of +1. If you play in a game with LA buyoff (I do), buying this off is trivial.Karsite (Tome of Magic) by kadeityUm, Karsite, the +2LA race from Tome of Magic, makes an amazing warlock.They get +2con &amp;amp; +2cha as well as spell resistance 10+class levels, and heal 2hp for every spell level of a spell that fails against their SR. Sure they cant be spellcasters, but they can use Spell like abilities normally. And a side note, they can be psions, not that it matters. they have another cool ability that makes a magic item inactive for a round. All this in addition to the human feat and skill points. I think the 2LA is worth it.Anyway I'm saying this because i recall someone saying they couldn't find a good warlock race.Petal (Monster Manual 3) by NatchFeralPetal [Tiny Fey] +2 LA, gives -8 Str +10 Dex +4 Con +4 Int +8 ChaWith an elite array for ability scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 ) this could give you:&amp;nbsp;Str 4 Dex 24 Con 17 Int 14 Wis 8 Cha 23. Seems ideal for a warlock.Pixie (Monster Manual 1) by mjungI personally like the pixie warlock. Sure, you pay 4 LA, but you more than make up with it with versatility and utter ridiculousness.&amp;nbsp;Pixie gives you:+8 dex and +6 cha (amongst other stat adjustments)Small size. Harder to hit and easier to hit others60 foot (good) fly speedDodge as a bonus feat+1 natural armorDR 10/cold iron, Spell resistance 15+levels and persistent (suppressible) greater invisibility.Some nice SLAs.This race was made for warlocks. You can fly around, invisible and hurl little eldritch blasts at your enemies. Best thing is, you are virtually guaranteed damage and you are virtually untouchable.Because Eldritch Blast is a ranged touch attack, your target gets no armor or natural armor bonuses to their AC.Unless your target can see invisibility, they further get no dex or dodge bonus to AC and you get a +2 on your attacks against sighted targets.So let's see...they don't get dodge, dex, armor or natural armor bonuses...they still get um...size...and um...deflection. With +8 to your dex, some BAB, +2 for being invis and +1 for being small, you can virtually guarantee a hit EVERY TIME.So what about when they strike back? Oh well, first they have to find you (invisible). Then they have to reach you somehow (flying). Then they have to hit you (small size and high dex). Then they have to overcome either your spell resistance or your damage reduction. Not very likely they'll be hitting you much.You can see where all this is going. Sure, a fighter could dish out more damage in one round. But your steady once per round 7d6 and nigh untouchability will certainly make you a force to be reckoned with. With the right feat selection and items, I truly believe this character would be just about invincible unless the DM specifically is trying to take you down. You can outlast just about anything in the game.Primordial Giant Template (Secrets of Xen’drik) by tacoronteIn the most recent Eberron Setting book, Secrets of Xen’drik, there is a new template for Giants &quot;Primordial Giant&quot; that makes Warlock a favored class for the character, enhances mental stats (with penalty on physical), adds a Spell-like ability and gives a +1 bonus on caster level for Spell-like Abilities.Best of all, it doesn't increase Level Adjustment; making something like an Ogre/Troll/Half-Giant more playable as a Warlock.For instance a Primordial Giant Ogre (LA +2) would have stat adjustments of +6 STR, -2 DEX, +2 CON, no mental penalties, and if you throw in Practiced Spellcaster, you are just 1 caster level behind a typical Warlock.That is a fair trade-off for a melee/hideous blow oriented Warlock.Whisper Gnome (Races of Stone) by EytanWhisper Gnomes make great Warlock/Arcane Tricksters. They have a more serious demeanor - perfect for warlocks, huge bonuses on stealth total +4 Move Silently + 8 hide, and they have mage hand as a spell like ability. Also, the +2 to dex and con is very nice. The -2 to charisma is a little tough, but this warlock build really doesn't rely too much on eldritch essence invocations, though they don't hurt. The invocations they really want are:Entropic Warding - good protection from ranged attacks which is really what they need because they don't want to be in melee. It also adds to their stealthiness by making it impossible to track them, even using scent.Invisibility (or Improved Invisibility)Beguiling Influence - +6 diplomacy, bluff, intimidateSpider ClimbFlee the Scene - Short range dimension door + brief major imageFlight&amp;nbsp;Dark Discorporation&amp;nbsp;Shadow Walk&amp;nbsp;I like these because they really compliment rogue (adding a lot of maneuverability, which in term increases defense). Also, they fit the shadowy sneakiness of rogues. You also have a crazy magical sneak attack.Xeph (Expanded Psionics Handbook) by ThinbladeXephs deserve a special mention since they are innately psionic. This opens the door to taking Psionic Shot, Greater Psionic Shot, and Psionic Meditation without having to spend a feat on Wild Talent or lose caster levels dipping into Psion or Psychic Warrior. Their +2 Dex is also nice for hitting with your eldritch blast.Prestige ClassesCore and Complete BooksArcane Trickster (DMG) by ThinbladeA way to advance invocations and sneak attack. Requires the feat spell hand (Complete Arcane) and a lesser invocation, plus 2d6 sneak attack. This is one of the few classes with the requirement “one spell of X level,” which let warlocks enter, as opposed to “spells of X level,” which don’t. A neat trick, if you don’t want to give up three levels to thief, is to instead use the feats Martial Study and Martial Stance to get Assassin’s Stance. Since you can be in a stance indefinately and can’t be knocked out of it, you can use it to qualify for any PrC that requires sneak attack dice. It doesn’t help with the ranks in thief skills, though (7 ranks in Disable Device, Decipher Script, and Escape Artist). Apprentice won’t help here, which means you’ll need to be human or have a high Int, and be at least level 11.Note: If you have the Planar Handbook, go join the Society of Sensation. A human Ardent Dilettante gets 7 + Int skill points into any skill. The PrC costs you a caster level, but boy does it do a number on skill reqs.Blood Magus (Complete Arcane) h/t DastardlyDanAnother of the rare PrC’s requiring “caster level,” Blood Magus is most likely a 4 level PrC, and a sub-par one at that. It’s 8/10 casting, losing levels at 5 and 10, which is bad enough, but it&amp;nbsp; requires two dud feats for entry. One of them is Toughness, arguably the worst feat ever printed, certainly the worst in Core. and the fact that many of the abilities, like blood component and several abilities after you lose a caster level at 5, don’t work with invocations. If you really want to take this PrC, talk to your DM about allowing you take Improved Toughness from Complete Warrior instead. It also requires that you have died and been brought back, which is problematical at low levels of play (though, arguably, the Hellbred race gets this by default). Probably best taken with crafter warlocks to get the free brew potion and scribe scroll feats, but since you give up two feats to get in, and both feats are limited by your body, I’d rather just take the feats and leave the PrC alone.Daggerspell Mage (Complete Adventurer) by ThinbladeAnother way to get sneak attack, this is the easiest PrC to get into, requiring two useless feats (weapon focus: dagger and two weapon fighting) and one level of thief (or Assassin’s Stance). Unfortunately, none of the class features work with invocations, so you pretty much just get sneak attack. Personally, I’d go with Arcane Trickster.Divine Oracle (Complete Divine) by Thinblade: A warlock can get into this class with two divination invocations by 5th level. Unfortunately, there are only two divination invocations in Complete Arcane, see the unseen and dark foresight, and dark foresight is Dark, so of limited use. Things like Devil’s Sight don’t help, since they don’t copy divination spells. If you have Complete Mage, however, there is one more divination: all-seeing eyes, which isn’t all that bad and allows you to qualify with two least invocations.The class itself is 10/10 spellcasting and gives trap sense, a better form of evasion, and improved uncanny dodge. Unfortunately, most of the other abilities don’t work with warlock invocations.Eldritch Disciple (Complete Mage) by ThinbladeThis class is perhaps unique in that it is a dual-progression PrC that doesn’t require you to be third level in both classes before entering. Definitely cleric-centered, since you need 2nd level divine spells but only least invocations. You lose a divine caster level at level one as well, but for two levels of cleric casting you get eleven on warlock, plus yet more options for things to do with turn undead attempts instead of, oh, turning undead.Eldritch Theurge (Complete Mage) by ThinbladeA more standard double progression PrC, which requires 2nd level arcane spells and 2d6 blast, the Theurge has some nice synergy between the two sides of the class. Characters in the class are probably going to be blasters (whether wizard blasters or warlock blasters) so make sure that’s the role you want to play. Also, decide whether you want to use Spellweave, because if you do you’ll want to pick up some eldritch essences to apply to your spells.Enlightened Spirit (Complete Mage) by ThinbladeGood in concept, horrible in execution. Enlighened Spirit is an attempt to make a PrC for a “redeemed” warlock. Unfortunatetly, it doesn’t advance invocations at all. Instead you get a few specific invocations (a fell flight duplicate, tongues, any blast shape that’s not Dark, and a couple of anti-fiend and undead blasts). The only good thing about it is that it increases blast damage 1d6/2 levels, but really, with Hellfire Warlock, why would you bother? Maybe worth it for a 1 level dip if you’re constantly fighting incorporeal stuff and the miss chance is messing with you, otherwise, stay away.Fortune’s Friend (Complete Scoundrel) by ThinbladeThe lucky warlock. I’m including this one for completeness. Its abilities are neat and it’s really easy to enter, but it’s only 2/5 spellcasting. For my money, you give up too much just to be lucky.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil by Thinblade:Oddly enough, the warlock can get into one of the more powerful wizard PrC’s, due to IotSV’s entry requirement of “5 abjuration spells, 2 of which must be 4th level or higher.” Just take entropic shield (least), cold comfort (lesser), voracious dispelling (lesser, 4th), relentless dispelling (lesser, 4th), and devour magic (greater, 6th). Of course, that means you have to spend three of your seven total invocations on different ways of doing the exact same thing: dispel.You can, of course, dip a level in another spellcasting class to pick up some abjuration spells. The obvious one is wizard, for Warlock 12/Wizard 1/IotSV 7. You’ll still need to keep devour magic and one of the other two dispel magic invocations, but you could free up to three other invocations. To avoid multiclassing penalties, you could also take a level in a separate spellcasting PrC, like Nentyar Hunter (Unapproachable East), Prime Underdark Guide (Underdark), or Ur-Priest. The easiest I’ve found to enter so far is Holy Liberator. Any of these options loses you a dark invocation, but gets you back up to three least and lesser invocations. If you go this path, you should probably also pick up Caster's Lament (and swap devour magic out for something else) so you can put all your bonuses to work counterspelling.Invisible Blade (Complete Warrior) by ThinbladeYet another way to get sneak attack for your warlock, this time without multiclassing into thief. However, sneak attack is the only thing this PrC has going for it: it doesn’t increase invocations or your blast, and requires two useless feats - far shot and weapon focus: dagger. Arcane trickster will end up giving you more sneak attack dice and cost you two fewer levels of invocations, which gives you the Dark invocations you miss this way.Mindbender (Complete Arcane) by ThinbladeGenerally considered a one level only PrC, Mindbender works as well for a warlock as a wizard, though you must take the Charm invocation and therefore be at least level 6. If you take this, also take the Mindsight feat from Lords of Madness.Mythic Exemplar (Complete Champion) by ThinbladeThis class is easy to get into (BAB +5), but doesn’t offer a tremendous amount back. You lose a caster level at Level 1, and the gained abilties are more geared towards wizards and based off of Intelligence. Not useless, but not great either. Also, don’t take the last level. You lose another caster level, and you don’t have any arcane spells to convert to divinations.Paragnostic Apostle (Complete Champion) by ThinbladeAnother easy class to get into (three Rank 5 Knowledge skills), and depending on the campaign, could be valuable. It’s 5/5 spellcasting, and offers a range of abilities based off of Knowledge. A few of the better ones: +1 to hit anything with natural armor, +1 to DC of any secondary blast effect with a saving throw (and maybe also things like chilling tentacles), and a favored enemy look-alike. If you’re already going the sage route, have skill points to burn, or are looking for any way to increase blast DC’s, look into this one.Uncanny Trickster (Complete Scoundrel) by ThinbladeIf you’re using skill tricks, this isn’t necessarily a bad class. It’s three levels long, only requires skills and skill tricks to enter, and is 2/3 advancing of previous class abilities (just like Legacy Chamion). This can be used to get another +4d6 hellfire, if you’ve already taken Hellfire Warlock.Unseen Seer (Complete Mage) by ThinbladeWarning! This class needs some finagling to enter. Check with your DM. A better way of getting sneak attack than something like Daggerspell Mage, this class will require a one level dip into another arcane spellcasting class and a bunch of sneaky cross-class skills to enter (beguiler is recommended, since one level gets you both). Once in, apply your +1 to caster level to warlock, not whatever you used to get in. Many of the bonus features don’t work with invocations, but you do get permanent non-detection, sneak attack, and a bunch of low-level divination spells (like true strike).Note: As if this class needed another note, you also need to check with your DM as to whether the Seer’s ability will grant you sneak attack dice if you don’t already have them. The class doesn’t say, and SA dice aren’t required to enter, unlike, say Arcane Trickster.Virtuoso (Complete Adventurer) by VaingloryVirtuoso looks like a decent warlock prestige class, and the flavor fits great with a fey oriented warlock. Drawbacks are no spell progression first level, and getting 10 perform. To reach the 10 perform required you could take level 1 as human paragon, or be a rogue with able learner. The Apprentice: Entertainer feat (DMG II) could also help the pain.Solo: Marshal gets Perform as a class skill, which may be useful if you have a high Charisma score.Warshaper (Complete Warrior) by ThinbladeSimple to enter if your DM allows you to take the Dragonfire Adept invocation Humanoid Shape (and if you can, you should). It doesn’t advance warlock casting, but does give a number of nice benefits: immunity to critical hits, an essentially-permanent +4 Str/Con, +5 feet of reach, and eventually permanent fast healing. I generally wouldn’t go more than two or three levels, unless you’re aiming for a bladelock. In any event, don’t take it all the way, since the level 5 ability may or may not work. It allows you to change shape as a move action, but Humanoid Shape is an invocation. Check with your DM about how it interacts.Wild Mage (Complete Arcane) by Thinblade: The crazy warlock. This one requires talking to your DM. First see if you can substitute a meta-SLA feat for the required metamagic feat, otherwise you’ll be stuck with Sudden Quicken. Second, ask whether the Wild Mage ability applies to your eldritch blast, as well as your invocations. Then think hard about whether you want to introduce that much chaos into your gaming group. Most players try to minimize chaos.If you do decide to go for it, the class is 10/10 spellcasting, requires the aforementioned metamagic feat, a dud feat (Magical Aptitude), and some skills that you were probably getting anyway. And at level 10 it offers a nice way of making an enemy mage have a very bad day.Races BooksChameleon (Races of Destiny) by ThinbladePrimarily used as a 2 level dip to get the floating feat, which can be used to get almost any invocation (through extra invocation), or almost any item creation feat, if you’re focusing on crafting. Note, however, that you cannot use the arcane or divine focus to get into otherwise barred PrC’s.Ruathar (Races of the Wild) by TealgorthianReally easy requirements. Easier than most any PrC in print, I think. It also has 3/3 +1 spellcasting levels, and some minor benefits. The most useful of which are the minor magic item you are given, and the extended lifespan. Also, it expands your skill list a bit.Thinblade note: Ruathar has the wonderful ability of having all Knowledge skills as class skills. This allows a warlock to get PrC skill requirements (like Nature or Survival) much faster than on their own without having to sacrifice invocations and blast progression multiclassing. Adding ruathar to the mix suddenly makes things like Sentinel of Bharri and Swanmay easy without the messiness the Apprentice feat can open up.Scar Enforcer (Races of Destiny) by surrealScar enforcer is a rather underwhelming PrC, but in this case it's very good for a multiclass warlock with rogue or ranger levels who wants to focus on being social and stealthy. Invocations like Entropic Shield hides your movement, big boosts to your skills with Leaps and Bounds and Beguiling Influence, the various movement granters, etcThinblade note: It’s 5/10 spellcasting, grants +3d6 sneak attack, and has a whole bunch of thief-type skills. Not great, but at least it’s another option for those of you dying to have both sneak attack and some amount of invocation progression.Shadowcraft Mage (Races of Stone) by ThinbladeWith the release of Complete Mage, the warlock gained the ability to enter the Shadowcraft Mage prestige class by using Walk Unseen, Wall of Gloom, and Nightmares Made Real (one good, one bad, and one iffy invocation). However, since no invocation duplicates figment or shade illusions, the best parts of the class are unavailable. The only class feature that actually works is cloak of shadow. Still, if an invocation ever gets published that mimics, say, Major Image, this would suddenly become an amazing class for warlocks.General D&amp;amp;D BooksArdent Dilettante (Planar Handbook) by ThinbladeThis one’s so weird I just have to go try to make one. 9/10 spellcasting, but requiring increasingly difficult requirements to advance. By the end, you have to have skills all over the place, be able to cast both arcane and divine 1st level spells, proficiency with martial and exotic weapons, and have died (that one won’t be a problem). I have no idea whether or not you could optimize an ardent dilettante, but it sure would be different! Since all skills are class skills, you can take a few levels to satisfy another PrC’s skill req’s (arcane trickster, I’m looking at you), though you lose a caster level.Child of Night (Tome of Magic) by ThinbladeIf it weren’t for its being 9/10 casting and requiring one of the worst invocations to enter (darkness), this would be a great PrC. As it is, it’s still good, and is one of the better fits thematically. Want a dark, spooky, more-than-human warlock? Look no further. Not all of the shadowy invocations are great, but there’s enough of them for you to fill your roster and still be useful. And never needing to eat or breathe is also nice. Since you’re stuck with darkness, you can also look into the various darkness feats in Drow of the Underdark.Demonbinder (Drow of the Underdark) by ThinbladeMust be a drow warlock. Gain a variety of abilities by binding demons to yourself, each demon giving a different set of abilities that can be easily changed between battles. Make sure you can buy off the LA before thinking about this one, though, since warlocks deal with caster level loss even worse than most casters.Disciple of Asmodeus (Book of Vile Darkness) by ThinbladeAs scrollreader says: “The eeeeeeevil warlock.” Fits thematically, is easy to enter (just two class skills, one cross-class skill, and a couple of feats), and gives 6/10 spellcasting, which means one dark invocation at level 20. Also gives the ability to cast charm person, which allows you to dip into Mindbender without wasting an invocation on Charm. See the builds section for an example.Fleshwarper (Lords of Madness) by ChemusRequires the feats Find Familiar (Complete Arcane) and Graft Flesh, plus points in a cross-craft skill (Heal), but grants 9/10 spellcasting and turns you into an aberration at 10th level.Hellfire Warlock (Fiendish Codex II) by ThinbladeThe ultimate in warlock blasting. A nifty little 3 level PrC that gives +6d6 blast and 3/3 invocations, and all it wants is a mediocre blast essence in return. If you’re ok with the flavor, there’s very little reason not to take this class. See also: Legacy Champion PrC, Strategies Section.Note: There are huge, vicious thread wars being fought over the legality and practicality of the two prime ways to heal/negate the Con damage: the incarnum soulmeld Strongheart Vest and the vestige Naberius. Everyone agrees that simply getting Naberius through a feat doesn’t work (you can’t bind him and get the ability healing). Everyone also agrees that taking one level of Binder and then binding Naberius works. But that loses you a level of warlock, which is the same that happens if you take a level of incarnate.The wars are over whether the vest, taken through a feat (which means it always reduces ability damage by 1) violates the class ability, which says “(if) you are somehow immune to Constitution damage you cannot use this ability.” One side says that since hellfire ever only deals one point of damage, the vest makes you immune to the hellfire damage, and therefore you can’t use it. The other side counters that DR 1/- doesn’t mean you’re immune to physical damage, and neither does this, and besides, flavor-wise, what you’re doing is siphoning off energy from the souls of the multiverse to your selfish ends, which fits the theme of the Nine Hells to a tee. We’ve been arguing since the class first appeared, and no consensus has been reached, nor does it look like it ever will. End result: check with your DM.Keeper of the Cerulean Sign (Lords of Madness) by ChemusRequires the feat Aberration Banemagic, which has no prereqs but may or may not work with invocations (talk to your DM). The class itself is still open, even if you can’t get the +2d6 to aberrations, though, and is 10/10 spellcasting. Requires two cross-craft skills, as well (Gather Information 5 and Knowledge – Dungeoneering 8 )Thinblade note: This is actually a lot harder to get into than it looks, since you have to create a wondrous item by yourself, which requires Warlock 12. Since you can’t get 8 ranks of Dungeoneering until level 13, your maximum level in KotCS is 7 pre-epic. If you can take the Apprentice: Philosopher or Spellcaster feat (DMG II), or Education (FRCS/EbCS) to make Dungeoneering a class skill, you can get in a level early (and pick up a cohort in the process with a 1st level feat). Can't get around the crafting requirement, however.Legacy Champion (Weapons of Legacy) by ThinbladeLegacy Champion is an odd duck. It’s a PrC that offers 8/10 advancement of your original class abilities. This is the only way to continue to advance things like your DR, fiendish resilience, or energy resistance as well as your invocations and blast. For pure blaster warlocks willing be a little cheesy (though completely RAW-legal), use Legacy Champion to advance Hellfire Warlock for truly awe-inspiring eldritch blasts (and 2 dark invocations). And this is in addition to all of the abilities tied to legacy items. Restriction: you must have a legacy item, so if they aren’t in your game, you’re out of luck.Platinum Knight (Draconomicon) by ThinbladeOne of the old-style gish PrC’s, Platinum Knight gives BAB +10 and 5/10 spellcasing. Of note is the 5th level ability which adds Cha bonus to saves (stacks with divine grace). It requires +5 BAB to enter, so a pure warlock would need to be level 7 to enter.Sand Shaper (Sandstorm) by TealgorthianTo me, the jury is still out on this one. It's 8/10 +1 spellcasting, but you don’t get many of the major class features of the PrC. Really, the only things you do get are Sandform, Sandstride (Improved) Sand Shape, Desert Slumber and Desert Shroud. The PrC is cool, and flavorful, but you want to get the best out of it, play a Sorcerer or Warmage.Sentinel of Bharri (Book of Exalted Deeds) by ThinbladeRangers, eat your heart out. The sentinel is a full casting PrC that gives a host of wilderness abilities (including Track, bonuses to Hide, and bear shape and summoning) and four energy resistances. The only problem is that you need Knowledge (nature) 8 and a couple of exalted feats. You can get around the skill problem with the feat Educated (FRCS/EbCS), but it doesn’t really fit thematically, and it means your early levels are feat-strapped. Still, it’s one of only two primary caster exalted PrC’s, and the easier to get into. See the builds section for an example.Thinblade note: You know, sometimes I should read my own guide. Warlock 6/Ruathar 3 gives the needed skills without Education, freeing a feat and removing the necessity of using campaign-specific material. Ruathar also fits much better, thematically, than Education. Your other option is Apprentice: Woodsman, but you’ll need to be human to get in with Warlock 5.Swanmay (Book of Exalted Deeds) by Thinblade: I knew if I looked hard enough I could find a use for Call of the Wild (CM), the invocation that grants wild empathy and speak with animals, and I finally have. The swanmay, a 9/10 spellcasting class that requires both. Unfortunately, it also requires two woodsy skills that the warlock doesn’t get, and one of them’s Survival, which means Education won’t help. A pure warlock won’t get in until level 14.This is where the PrC Ruathar (see above) really comes in handy. It has both skills, and enough skill points to get both up to 8 in three levels (neglecting everything else, but hey). Now you can get in as a Warlock 6/Ruathar 3, instead of Warlock 13. Like Sentinal of Bharri, a Warlock 5 with Apprentice: Woodsman can also get in, but you’ll need to be human or use flaws for all the feats. If you’re using the warlock variant that has your power coming from fey, this is a great PrC for you.Also note that the text states that it only increases druid and ranger spellcasting. If you’re using a fey-themed warlock you should be able to talk your DM into letting it also advance warlock, but it doesn’t straight out of the book.Talon of Tiamat (Draconomicon) by ThinbladeTalon of Tiamat is another 5/10 spellcasting PrC that’s easier to enter than Platinum Knight (any evil, +4 BAB, a feat, and ranks in three class skills), but it only gives medium BAB instead of PK’s good. In return, you get an increasingly powerful breath weapon, immunity to one energy type, frightful presence, and possibly your very own dragon (via dominate dragon). You also get a bonus to Bluff and Intimidate, which, combined with Beguiling Influence can lead to some really high scores. Not a bad bunch of abilities, if you don’t mind losing dark invocations.Topaz Guardian (Lords of Madness) by Chemus:You have to be Chaotic Good, and it can’t be entered until 8th level (need BAB +5). It’s 3/5 spell progression, but +5 BAB (Warlock 15/TG 5 = BAB +16) with protecting aspects from the Topaz Diadem, so it might be useful for melee warlocks, especially glaivelocks.Urban Savant (Cityscape, p. 100) by Thinblade, h/t SurrealA 9/10 casting PrC that doesn’t lose a level until 10 (in exchange for an ability duplicated by a first level spell… ugh), you’re going to have to do some tap dancing to get in, as none of the four knowledge skills required are gained by the warlock. You’re going to want some combination of the following: able learner feat, educated feat, or the Paragnostic Apostle or Ruathar PrC’s. In return, you get a larger number of skill points and some archivist-like abilities to identify enemy weaknesses. Plus, you’re a walking library. Warlock 6/Paragnostic Apostle 5/Urban Savant 9 will have of ranks in seven different knowledge skills (Arcana, Religion, and Planes for PA, then Dungeoneering, Local, Nature, and History for UA).Visionary Seeker (Planar Handbook) by ThinbladeSure, a warlock can easily enter this class (all you need is Knowledge (any) 8 ), but why would you want to? It’s 5/10 spellcasting and you can’t make use of the divination boost. Spell mimic could be really cool (cast any spell you’ve seen in the past 24 hours, of a level up to your VS level), but you can’t use it very often.Forgotten Realms BooksCrinti Shadow Marauder (Shining South) by ThinbladeOne of the few PrC’s to give Shadow Pouncing (the ability to make a full attack after teleporting). See numerous shadow pounce builds scattered throughout the board for how deadly this can be. Doesn’t get the ability until the end of this 5 level class, and you need the feats Mounted Combat and Stealthy, and a whole host of cross-class skills. Oh, and by the way, you have to be half-drow (Crinti). You only need flee the scene if you want to shadow pounce off your horse.Telflammar Shadowlord (Unapproachable East) by ThinbladeThe other primary shadow pouncing PrC. Gets the ability at level 4, but requires Flee the Scene, multiclassing, and a bunch of feats. Shadow pounce just isn’t easy to get. See my treatise on building Nightcrawler in the Miscellany section for an example of shadow pouncing.Eberron BooksCyran Avenger (5 Nations) by ThinbladeA 4/5 spellcasting, +5 BAB class that gives some interesting options for a warlock. Avenging strike adds Cha to attack and 1d6 damage/Avenger level to anyone who’s attacked any member of your party (much like a paladin’s smite). At 3rd level you can apply it to your eldritch blast and go to town. This class gives you a reason to have a high Charisma, so also pick up invocations that have save DC’s as well. Probably requires multiclassing into ranger to pick up required BAB, Survival, and Track.There are two other options for entry. The first is the Apprentice: Woodsman feat from DMG II, which can then be parlayed into Leadership at level 10. Be sure you’re willing to put the time in, however. The other is Sentinal of Bharri, which gives everything warlock lacks. Go human warlock 5/SB 10/CA 5 and unleash angry bears on those who dared to attack your home!Escalation Mage (Faiths of Eberron) by widowTwo easy skill req's, one metamagic feat, caster level 5th, and you must worship the shadow (Eberron specific). It is 6 levels long and nets you a number of extend, empower, widen, quicken, and heighten spells or spell-like abilities a day. Also gives full caster progression.Primal Scholar (Eberron: SoX) by Part-Human25 lvl PrC - full caster progression but requires Mysterious Magic feat, a Metamagic feat and 10 ranks in Knowledge (history) which are a waste to get.Invocation GuideThinblade’s note: Invocations from Complete Arcane were written by Tealgorthian and are unmarked. Dragon Magic warlock (DM) and dragonfire adept (DA) invocations were written by cheezgrater. Complete Mage (CM) and Cityscape invocations were written by Richmud. Magic of Incarnum invocations written by FromTheShadows. Drow of the Underdark (DotU) invocations written by Lone Wolf.cheezgrater’s note about Dragonfire Adept invocations: These invocations are originally intended for the Dragonfire Adept (which functions like a warlock with breath weapons instead of eldritch blast). Use of these would require DM permission. However, since a lot of draconic invocations duplicate or are comparable to warlock invocations, it should be fairly easy to convince your DM to allow some of these. I have only selected the extremely useful invocations that can be justified for flavor with the Warlock. (Terrifying Roar and Frightful Presence just don't work for flavor).Eldritch EssencesEldritch Essences, LeastFrightful Blast: Handy for a low level VS will save, but the fact it doesn’t stack reduces it's viability quite a bit. If you take it at low levels, I'd suggest replacing it with something stronger ASAP.Hammer Blast (CM): You deal full damage to objects. Doesn't strike me as that necessary.Sickening Blast: I prefer this to Frightful Blast, but most monsters tend to have a better Fort save than Will, which, again, limits it's uses. Another one that needs to be replaced ASAP.Eldritch Essences, LesserBaneful Blast (CM): 2d6 extra vs. selected type. Unless you are in a campaign fighting a lot of SR free creatures of the same type, it’s not going to help you.Beshadowed Blast: Another Fort save Essences, and somewhat better than Sickening Blast. Blinding your enemy can be just as effective as Invisibility sometimes. A good low level power, but should be replaced.Brimstone Blast: Your first Ref save blast, and it's pretty crappy. It can be easily simulated with something like Alchemist's Fire. I'd only take this if you seem to be facing an abnormal amount of creatures that need fire.Deteriorating Blast (DM): Extremely useful against foes with DR. The ability to drop DR by 5 points can greatly shorten encounters.Hellrime Blast: The only stat affecting Essence, and it turns out to be a penalty instead of damage. Mediocre at best. I'd take Beshadowed Blast over this, they are both Fort targeting.Eldritch Essences, GreaterBewitching Blast: Meh. I've never even considered taking this power. The duration is too short for me to consider. There are MUCH better Essences at this level you can take.Hindering Blast (CM): Save vs. slow, could be useful.Incarnum Blast (Incarnum): The usefulness of this depends on how far your alignment varies from that of your enemies. If it doesn't, this invocation is useless. If it does, you have a source of dazing and possible bonus damage. Not exceptional, but not horrible.Noxious Blast: If you still have Sickening Blast, you should definitely dump it now, and take this power in it's place. This Invocation can take a monster out of the fight for 1 min. Awesome.Penetrating Blast (DM): A blaster's best friend +4 bonus on checks to beat SR, plus a hit drops the target's SR by 5. This makes high SR enemies much more manageable.Repelling Blast: A kind of middle of the road blast. I use it with things like Chilling Tentacles and Wall of Perilous Flame. If you want a straight blaster, look else where. If you are going for battlefeild control, this is the blast for you!Vitriolic Blast: The king of the Greater Essences, this is the -only- Essence that allows you to ignore SR, and is therefore a must have in my book. It makes you viable in combat against high SR monsters, and the bane of all casters, Golems.Eldritch Essence, DarkBind Blast (CM): Save vs. stun for 1 round. It seems too short to waste a dark invocation on.Utterdark Blast: My personal favorite blast, it's the only way a Warlock can deal negative levels. Given time, he can reduce even the most powerful enemy to almost nil. Seems to be the most effective when used with any of the AoE Shapes (Cone, Doom, and Chain)Blast ShapesBlast Shapes, LeastEldritch Glaive (DM): A must-have for any warlock that ever finds himself in melee; reach, iterative attacks, and attacks of opportunity with your eldritch blast make this invocation a no-brainerEldritch Spear: The usefulness of this invocation varies greatly depending on the style of Warlock you wish to play. A long range sniper will get the most use, but remember that using this Shape denies you the use of higher level shapes. I have yet to take this ability.Hideous Blow: The primary shape of all Melee Warlocks (before Dragon Magic). It can give the Warlock an almost-like Sneak Attack ability. Again, use varies on play style.Thinblade note: Almost no one took this before Dragon Magic. Now, no one takes it.Blast Shapes, LesserEldritch Chain: Less useful than some other shapes, it can be used to Repel multiple targets, or issue multi-target debuffs, till you run out of Blast damage. My favorite combination is Chain + Utterdark Blast.Blast Shapes, GreaterEldritch Cone: I find this to be the least useful of the AoE Shapes, but many, many others disagree with me. It offers one of the largest AoE effects, and doesn’t require the Ranged Touch attack. It does offer a Ref save for half damage. Could be useful with Fell Flight and fired from straight above.Eldritch Line (DM): Meh. Eldritch Blast as a line attack. In most situations Cone or Chain are going to be better.Blast Shapes, DarkEldritch Doom: This Shape puts the Warlock were he doesn’t really wanna be: in the middle of all the fighting. That's the only way it is effective. Melee Warlocks can find this power useful if they are surrounded. Combined with Repelling Blast, it can even the odds fairly quickly.Least InvocationsAll Seeing Eyes (CM): Search and spot bonus and comprehend language for written things. Not bad for a scouting/spying oriented warlockBaleful Utterance: Unlimited Shatters as the spell. very very very useful.&amp;nbsp;Beguiling Influence: Will see the most use in Warlocks that want to make good negotiator. The use is limited because Diplomacy is not a class skill for Warlocks, sadly. If you add levels of a social class (Rogue, Bard) the usefulness of this Invocation increases.Breath of the Night: I've not found a use for this Invocation yet. Fog Cloud can be a handy spell, but one that can be more easily duplicated with a magic item.Call of the Beast (CM): Wild empathy and speak with animals, very nice for RP if you going for a fey flavored warlock. (See also note in Miscellany.)Cocoon of refuse (Cityscape): Entangle a target while in a city, lasts 1 round/level or until they escape. Not a bad least if you remain in cities.Dark One's Own Luck: A luck bonus to your saves based on your Charisma for 24 hours, but limited by your class level. It cant be used on more than 1 save at a time. That makes me less than excited about it.Darkness: The 3.5 version of Darkness is pretty crappy. If you used the 3.0 version.. yeah, go for it.Devil's Sight: When the Warlock was first introduced, there was a lot of excitement about this combined with Darkness, but it turns out that it isn’t all it's cracked up to be. There are better things to use your Invocation slots on.Drain Incarnum (Incarnum) - Crap. Wow, you can do a single point of Wisdom or essentia damage and they get a save? Not worth it, even at lower levels. Easily one of the worst invocations published.Earthen Grasp: Since the spell sucks, I think this invocation sucks too.Endure Exposure (DA): Endure Elements could be very useful during planar travel or in harsh environments. One of the few buffs you could share with your party. (Ignore line regarding granting immunity to your breath weapon).Entropic Warding: This Invocation is so good, I don’t know what else to say. 20% miss chance from ranged attacks, leaving no trail, cant be tracked by scent? Wow.&amp;nbsp;Leaps and Bounds: Might be good for multi-class Warlocks that get those skills on their list. Rogue and Monks come to mind immediately.Miasmic Cloud: Easy to catch your allies inside, easily dispersed. Might make a good low level Invocation to swap out laterOtherworldly Whispers (CM): Bonuses on 3 kinds of knowledge checks(predetermined) Useful if you are expected to be the one making those knowledge checks.See the Unseen: One of the best of the Least Invocations. 24 hour See Invisibility -and- Darkvision. I'll take two, and an order of fries.Serpents Tongue (CM): You get scent and a bonus vs. poison, scent is useful to make this worthwhileSoulreaving Aura (CM): You damage creatures that are at or below 0hp, the temp hp it provides when something dies only last for a round and that’s not enough to make it worthwhile.Spiderwalk: A great power for those Warlocks seeking to enhance their mobility options, esp. in caves, buildings, and cities.Summon Swarm: A decent low level power, the duration prevents you from summoning 400 Swarms.Swimming the Styx (CM): You get a swim speed equal to land speed and can breath water. Useful in a campaign with a lot of water.Lesser InvocationsCharm: Another solid invocation, this one can give you a temporary cohort. Can also be used to qualify for the Mindbender PrCCold Comfort (CM): Endure elements for you and everyone in 30ft, unusual for effecting allies. Good if the game is set in a harsh environment otherwise probably not a common enough need.Crawling Eye (CM): You detach your eye and send it out to spy. It’s good for scouting and spying. It’s also creepy.Curse of Despair: Not all that useful, since you need to be close enough to touch the target, but given that Bestow Curse can be a powerful ability, I say it depends on your Warlock-style.The Dead Walk: If you use the black onyx you can create an undead army in a day. Even without the onyx, it is a good ability to make a quick zombie in the middle of combat. If you take Utterdark Blast, you can heal your undead minions. With Eldritch Chain you can heal multiple targets. With Eldritch Cone you can heal your undead while affecting your enemies.Disembodied Hand (CM): You detach your hand and let it fly around. It can wield a weapon and get up into combat without endangering you as much, also good for delivering a touch spell. It’s more creepy then effective though.Dread Seizure (DM): Hrmm...this invocation isn't bad, but there are several that are better. Half movement and reduced reach attacks are nice, but the duration is too short and you are too limited in invocation selection to waste time with this.Enthralling Voice (DA): The ability to fascinate listeners can potentially be useful for a skill/talk oriented warlock. Not very useful in combat (at least, not very often).Fell Flight: The crown jewel of Warlock mobility, the spell can give you flight you can turn on and off all day long. Awesome invocationFlee the Scene: Another awesome mobility invocation. A good way to create confusion among your enemies. Too bad the range was shortened so much.&amp;nbsp;Humanoid Shape (DA) (TB): Humanoid shape, if allowed (it’s technically a Dragonfire Adept invocation), is easily one of the best lesser invocations ever printed. Assume the form of any humanoid creature. Become an avariel and fly faster than Fell Flight (though with average, not good, maneuverability). Use to get a large bonus on disguise checks anywhere. And it can also be used to enter the Warshaper prestige class.Hungry Darkness: I'm not sure what the use of this Invocation is. It only lasts if you concentrate, and it's only Darkness with a bat swarm. Seems useless.Ignore the Pyre (DM): Energy resistance equal to your caster level? Very useful (you can have resistance to three types between this invocation and your class features).Mask of Flesh (CM): You take on the appearance of someone you touch, and can also give them a cha penalty. It’s interesting though quite limited.Relentless Dispelling (CM): Targeted dispel two rounds in a row for just one standard action sounds like a deal.Spider-shape (DotU): Lets you transform yourself into a fiendish spider of Small or Medium size. This is a polymorph effect, and the invocation scales as you gain levels, increasing the range of sizes you can assume. At 8th level, you add Large to list of possible sizes; at 11th, you add Tiny; at 15th, Huge; and at 20th level, Gargantuan. Lasts a number of hours equal to your caster level or until you choose to end it.Steal Incarnum (Incarnum): Nothing fantastic, even if you're playing in an Incarnum-heavy game. If you aren't, avoid this invocation like the plague.Stony Grasp: Just as useless as Earthen Grasp.Sudden Swarm (DotU): Lasts 24 hours or until its effect is triggered. When you kill a creature with one of your invocations (including eldritch blast), a swarm of spiders bursts from the corpse. Has the statistics of a normal spider swarm, except it adds your warlock level to its hit points and the save DC for its poison. The swarm is under your mental control and fights as you direct it; commanding it is a free action. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your caster level or until it's destroyed. It can only take a standard action in the round it emerges, and you can only have one swarm in existence at a time; if you would create a second swarm, you can either choose to create the second one (the first disappears) or keep the first swarm and not create a second one.Thief's bane (Cityscape): It’s hold portal, and if they manage to bypass it through knock or dispel magic the door explodes, probably not worth a lesser invocation.Void Sense: Blindsense is a good ability, but I am not sure I would use an Invocation slot on it. Good candidate for the Extra Invocation feat.Voracious Dispelling: Good Invocation. with a high spell craft, and a readied action, this Invocation could make a Warlock a good counterspeller. Note that the effectiveness decreases as your increase with level, much like the effectiveness of Dispel Magic diminishes.Walk Unseen: I love this Invocation, but I never seen to have enough slots to take it. Who doesn’t want Invisibility at will?Wall of Gloom: Not a very useful Wall Invocation, and there are much much better ones at this level you can take.Thinblade Note: See Tleilaxu_Ghola’s comments about Wall of Gloom in the Miscellany section.Weighty Utterance (DM): Flying foes can find their styles seriously hampered by this invocation. You can only drop foes a maximum of 40 feet (at level 20), and it can only prevent flight for a maximum of 1 round when you force an enemy to the ground, meaning that the utility of this invocation is nowhere near what it could be. Possibly consider other options.Witchwood Step (CM): You get waterwalk and the ability to ignore undergrowth and rubble. Not bad, but not always worth the invocation slot.Greater InvocationsCaustic Mire (CM): You make an area deal acid damage and increase fire damage. Could be good in combo with brimstone blast and chilling tentacles to keep people in the mire.Chilling Tentacles: Awesome, awesome Invocation! This is one of the reasons Warlocks make such good battlefield controllers! Even if someone isn’t grappled, they still take cold damage.&amp;nbsp;Devil's whispers (Cityscape): Suggestion, after they perform the suggested action they must make another will save of believe it was their idea. Sounds like insidious fun to me.Devour Magic: I actually find this Invocation less useful than it's lower counterpart, since it can only be used as a targeted dispel, and as a touch spell. Flexibility is just something a Warlock can’t give up.Dragonward (DM): Great if there are a lot of dragon or dragonblood creatures in your campaign. Worse than useless otherwise.Enervating Shadow: A decent Invocation, but one that requires close proximity again. The Str penalty is nice, but there are better places to spend a Greater Invocation.Hellspawned Grace (CM): You turn into a hellcat but lose all your normal abilities. It lasts just long enough for one battle, so it could be useful.Nightmares Made Real (CM): You create an area that grants concealment and damages people who don't make the save to disbelieve, but most interestingly you can hide in plain site within the area.Painful Slumber of the Ages (CM): You put someone to sleep until they make a save or are disturbed. If disturbed they take damage. The damage is too low to really be useful but at least it makes them a little weaker if you have to wake them yourself.Tenacious Plague: A good swarm summoning spell, if that is your thing. The DC boost, and ability to treat the swarm as magical weapons for overcoming DR is pretty good. The number of swarms you summon can be pretty sick too.Wall of Perilous Flame: Another good battlefield control spell, made even better since half of the damage is not fire damage anymore.&amp;nbsp;Warlock's call: Uh. Sending isn’t that useful anyway, plus it can damage you. Sheer crap.Dark InvocationsCaster's Lament (CM): You can counter spells of 7th or lower, you can also use break enchantment. Countering has potential but it gets stopped by the really powerful stuff.Dark Discorporation: Why, oh why, would you take this? You can only take move actions! Blah! It basically negates your abilities to use Invocations at all. I'd rather not. I've been informed some people prefer this Invocation. Just goes to show you cant take -1- persons opinion as fact. There are instances where Swarm Traits and Immunities will be very useful, and the damage isn’t half bad. I prefer to have access to my Invocations and Eldritch Blast.&amp;nbsp;Dark Foresight: Eh, I wouldn’t take it. I've never found Foresight to be all that useful. The Telepathy picks up some of the slack, and is very useful for with the Charm use.Energy Immunity (DA): Complete Immunity to an element is nothing to snarl at. Potentially very useful.Fell (Draconic) Flight, Greater (DA): 30 foot faster fly speed than afforded by the lesser invocation version plus perfect maneuverability. Potentially useful if you find yourself wanting more airspeed.Impenetrable Barrier (DM): Opaque walls of force. Great for battlefield control. Dangerous if it gets dispelled, though.Incarnum Shroud (Incarnum): Not bad, but doesn't seem to be up to the standard of other Dark Invocations. In fact, I wouldn't have been surprised to see this as a Lesser (or maybe Greater, but that's pushing it) Invocation due to the fact that this seems to be an only slightly improved version of Entropic Warding.Instill Vulnerability (DA): Force energy vulnerability (150% Damage) on a foe (doesn't work on foes that are immune to that energy type). This can be very useful when coupled with an eldritch essence to deal energy damage. (Instill Vulnerability: Fire / Brimstone Blast)Path of Shadow: The only long range teleportation spell a Warlock gets, and it appears you can take your party along with you. Nice ability.Retributive Invisibility: Greater Invisibility at will, and it can damage everything around you if it is dispelled. Pretty good&amp;nbsp;Steal Summoning (CM): You take control of a summoned creature but in addition to being narrow it requires concentration and is probably not worth it as a dark.Word of Changing: Probably the most hilarious ability the Warlock gets, the ability to permanently Baleful Polymorph an enemy is usually too much for me to pass up.Miscellany&amp;nbsp;Warlock Level 1 by LiltI keep saying this on all warlock threads i see, and that's not just because I like to say it, but a level 1 warlock with the Summon Swarm power is GODLIKE compared to many other 1st level characters.&amp;nbsp;Let's see:Spell-like ability, Standard action to cast unless stated otherwise1d6 base damage, not much to write home aboutNo attack roll, Awesome when even your warrior hits less than half the timeArea effect, Hit up-to 4 targets at once, more if they're small creaturesShapeable area, form it so that it doesn't hit you or your allies meat-shieldsShortened duration, may seem a pain, but it prevents damage to allies meat-shieldsDistraction (DC 11-12 fort save or reduced to a move action) Awesome, even fighters have a good chance to failOne of the following based on swarm:1 damage a round from bleeding (Always useful, hit them with it first)Poison DC11 or Str Damage (Hit them with it once they're bleeding)Disease DC12 or Dex &amp;amp; Con Damage (Fun as a GM versus PCs!)Tactics:Round One: Hit them with a swarm of bats. All the ones you hit are now dead, they just don't know it yet.Round two: Dismiss the swarm, your meat shields can probably keep them from healing themselves, or just hit the BBEG with some spiders.Ok, so you'll want to swap it out once you hit 6th level as it becomes less useful, but it is an AWESOME invocation for the first 2-4 levels as it usually out-damages your Eldritch Blast, is your only area effect ability, and has other effects.Optimizing a warlock for damage by cheezegraterIf you are going for a pure damage build, the best place to drop warlock appears to be after level 11. Before level 11, eldritch blast increases by 1d6 every other level. Past 11, it only increases every third level.Rogue gains 1d6 sneak attack every other level (Why couldn't they have done this for warlocks?)Warlock 11 / Rogue 96d6 Eldritch Blast + 5d6 Sneak Attack = 11d6 damageAdd in 2d6 from Greater Chasuble = 13d6 damageUsing the Eldritch Glaive blast shape from Dragon Magic3 attacks at 13d6 = 39d6 damage (Avg. 136.5) damage per round.Not too shabby, especially when you consider that he gets a greater essence, the ability to take 10 on UMD checks, some of the better rogue class features (evasion anyone?) and a goodly number of skill points.I'm sure we could figure out how to pump the damage beyond this point, but for a simple and effective build, this makes a good starting point.Dipping into Incarnate for Hellfire Warlock builds by GraveFor 2 levels of Incarnate you can:Shape 3 soulmelds (and get 2 essentia) and bind one to the crown. Strongheart Vest is superior to Naberious (sp?) bind in that it reduces any ability damage by 1 (or more depending on invested essentia) when it occurs. Among other things, this allows you to make use of Hellfire more than once per round without worrying about accumulation of Con damage as the bind only heals 1 pt. per round irregardless of the damage taken. This is important for those builds throwing out Quickened EB's and those that want to make use of the Hellfire Shield.This still leaves you two slots of shaping and incarnates do have a very useful list of soulmelds to choose from. For example, Planar Ward makes you immune to possession, Enchantment (charm), and Enchantment (compulsion). Personally, I think that alone is worth it.Crystal Helm gives you +2 Will v. mind-affecting (not too important), and gives a deflection bonus equal to essentia invested (remember those 2 points you get automatically). This is very nice at the lower levels when Rings of Protection are so pricey. When you bind Crystal Helm to your Crown Chakra, all your melee attacks have the force descriptor for damage. This nice against incorporeal foes with Eldritch Glaive, but the real kicker is that Crystal Helm + Eldritch Glaive + Vitriolic Blast = attack that bypasses SR and is force, so nothing has either resistance or immunity to it (in your face Flesh Golem).Impulse Boots are great to have as they give you Uncanny Dodge.Pauldrons of Health can be useful in certain campaigns as they make a character immune to all disease and being nauseated or sickened. In addition, it offers an enhancement bonus to Fort. equal to essentia invested.And the list goes on.The best part is that you can choose which soulmelds are shaped at the start of every day and they last for as long you have them shaped which translates to a much needed increase in versatility that any Warlock build could use.2 levels only lose you 1 point of BAB and net a +3 to Fort and Will, and while 2 + Int skills is paltry (you're a Warlock, you should be used to it), it does have Concentration, all the useful knowledge skills (such as arcana), and Spellcraft which tend to be prereq's for many Warlock available PrC's on its class list.Quite frankly, I think that's a lot for just two levels. Granted, Binders are also very versatile, but as a class to dip for Hellfire Builds, I think Incarnate is superior as it still retains its versatility without having to worry about losing the one reason you took it: the ability to negate the Con damage. For a binder, they have to stick the Naberious bind or lose their Ability Point regeneration.&amp;nbsp;-Grave &amp;amp; Co.Using Bloodlines/Legacy Champion/Uncanny Trickster to Increase Eldritch Blast Damage by ThinbladeThis somewhat controversial trick doesn't work with a normal warlock, it's used in concert with Hellfire Warlock's Hellfire Blast.Hellfire Warlock gains +2d6 hellfire blast every level, over the course of three levels. Bloodline levels count as a level for any level-dependent class abilities (like monk stunning fist). It has therefore been argued that 3 bloodline levels would give Hellfire Warlock a &quot;virtual&quot; boost of three levels. You wouldn't gain any other kind of ability (since Hellfire Warlockdoesn't have any past level 3), but you would continue to gain +2d6 hellfire blast for each level above 3.The other way to boost hellfire blast is through the PrC's Uncanny Trickster and Legendary Champion. Both classes advance another class's abilities, instead of just advancing spellcasting. Again, it has been argued that you could use either to boost hellfire blast &quot;through the roof&quot; by applying those virtual levels to hellfire warlock, instead of normal warlock. The advantage of this over bloodlines is that you still gain all the niceties of actual class levels (like hit points, skills, and invocations) in addition to your blast.CustServ, it should be noted, has ruled in both directions multiple times, which really means it's down to your DM. Come up with a compelling argument and go for it. Both ways have disadvantages (losing three levels of hit points and invocations for bloodlines, and losing casting levels with the PrC's), so it's not entirely in one way.Making Nightcrawler by ThinbladeA common request on the CO boards is help in creating a D&amp;amp;D equivalent of a character from some other area of fiction. We’ve seen Final Fantasy Dragoons, Sonic the Hedgehog, a rather scary Jean Grey telekineticist, and plenty of others. Recently, I gave a lot of thought to creating a version of Nightcrawler using warlock in response to just such a request, and I figured I’d share.Warlock is actually a good choice to base a Nightcrawler build upon, since you can get unlimited dimension doors a day, allowing you to bamf around the battlefield at will, and the class’s flavor has the same dark feel as the inhuman-looking mutant. However, since invocations are standard actions, you’re forced to bamf, then wait until next turn to attack. Not very cool.Enter the Forgotten Realms (for its last few months of existence) and the PrC ability shadow pounce: the ability to make a full attack after the conclusion of any teleportation. Now we’re talking. Alternately, you can take one level of monk and the Sun School tactical feat in Complete Warrior, but that only gives one attack after teleporting, and therefore isn’t as cool. On to shadow pouncing.Of the two PrC’s that offer shadow pouncing (Crinti Shadow Marauder [Shining South] and Telflammar Shadowlord [Unapproachable East]), the Shadowlord gives it a level earlier, at 4th. Unfortunately, the entry requirements are brutal:Non-goodHide 10 ranks, Move Silently 10 ranksBlind-fight, Dodge, Mobility, Spring AttackDimension Door as spell or SLASneak attack +2d6Ouch. Obviously, we’re going to need to multiclass, and there are two main options: thief or ninja 3 or swordsage 2. Thief gets you evasion, ninja gets you poison use and limited invisibilty, but requires a higher Wisdon. Scout, unfortunately, doesn’t get +2d6 skirmish until later.Swordsage gets sneak attack through the shadow hand stance Assassin’s Stance (so make sure you’re DM’s okay with that way of qualifying). If you split the levels of swordsage around those of warlock, you can end up getting in with just Swordsage 2.Finally, if you want to get in by level 8-9, you need to play a race with a bonus feat: human, strongheart halfling, azurin, etc. Almost all of your feats will be used for Shadowlord entry requirements, and the one you have free should be Quicken SLA: Flee the Scene to get two full attacks in a turn. If you want others (two recommended are able learning and the eldritch claw feat from Dragon Magic), you’ll need to pick up some flaws from Unearthed Arcana.So your two basic Nightcrawler bases look like this:Thief 3/Warlock 6/Telflammar Shadowlord 4/X 7orSwordsage 1/Warlock 6/SS +1/TS 4/X 8X can be a lot of things. For this guide I’m going to assume you want to continue to advance warlock invocations. If you’re not, find some +1 BAB prestige class that looks interesting. If you are, a couple of PrC’s are interesting. Divine Oracle doesn’t give much in the way of BAB, but does have some nice defensive class features. Since you have SA dice (one way or another) and limited spellcasting from SL, you can also go into Unseen Seer, though you’ll have to use two of your three least invocations for the required divinations. The Child of Night PrC from Tome of Magic is a great atmospheric choice, advancing the shadowy nature of the character already established by the Shadowlord.If you got into TS through swordsage, you’re in the rare position of being a warlock that can enter Jade Phoenix Mage. Use your limited list of second level spells to enter, and apply the JPM advances to warlock, and bask in the fact that it’s a +1 BAB class. JPM opens up several really nice higher-level maneuvers, including a counter that teleports you when attacked (setting off shadow pouncing again), and two boosts that add fire damage to your attacks.Finally, if you have Tome of Battle, you should (regardless of path) pick up the maneuver shadow stride through the Martial Study feat. This allows you to shadow pounce twice in a round (three times if you quicken FtS as well). Get it at level 15 with JPM, level 18 without.Here are two versions of Nightcrawler, one using ToB, the other not. Both are assumed to be humans, without flaws.“Nightcrawler”Human Rogue 3/Warlock 6/Telflammar Shadowlord 4/Child of Night 7Rogue 1: Trapfinding, SA +1d6, Dodge, MobilityRogue 2: EvasionWarlock 1: Least invocation, Blind fightWarlock 2: Least invocation, Detect MagicWarlock 3: DR 1/cold ironWarlock 4: Darkness, Decieve Item, Spring AttackWarlock 5:&amp;nbsp;Warlock 6: Flee the SceneRogue 3: SA +2d6, Trapsense +1, Quicken: Flee the SceneTelflammar Shadowlord 1: Shadowsight, shadow jumpTelflammar Shadowlord 2: Shadow blurTelflammar Shadowlord 3: Shadow walk, FeatTelflammar Shadowlord 4: Shadow pounceChild of Night 1: Cloak of Shadows, cold resistance 5Child of Night 2: Sustaining shadow (eat 1 meal/week), FeatChild of Night 3: Dancing shadows 1/dayChild of Night 4: Cloak of shadows (blur 1/day) sustaining shadow (sleep 1 hour/day)Child of Night 5: Cold resistance 10, FeatChild of Night 6: Cloak of shadows (blur 3/day), sustaining shadow (immune to poison/disease)Child of Night 7: Dancing shadows 2/dayBAB 13; F/R/W: 6/11/12; Casts as Warlock 12 (6d6 blast, 1 Greater invocation)“Phoenix Nightcrawler” (ToB)Human Swordsage 1/ Warlock 6/SS +1/Telflammar Shadowlord 4/JPM 8Swordsage 1: Quick to Act +1, discipline focus (weapon focus), Cloak of Deception, 5 others, Dodge, Mobility&amp;nbsp;Warlock 1: Least invocation,&amp;nbsp;Warlock 2: Least invocation, Detect Magic, Blind fightWarlock 3: DR 1/cold ironWarlock 4: Least Invocation, Decieve ItemWarlock 5: Spring Attack&amp;nbsp;Warlock 6: Flee the SceneSwordsage 2: AC bonus, Assassin’s Stance, 1 maneuver (3rd)Telflammar Shadowlord 1: Shadowsight, shadow jump, Quicken: Flee the SceneTelflammar Shadowlord 2: Shadow blurTelflammar Shadowlord 3: Shadow walkTelflammar Shadowlord 4: Shadow pounce, Adaptive StyleJPM 1: +1 Man. known (4th) (Searing Blade), arcane wrath, rite of wakingJPM 2: Mystic phoenix stanceJPM 3: +1 Man. known (5th) (Leaping Flame), +1 Man. readied, Shadow StrideJPM 4: Empowering strikeJPM 5: +1 Man. known (6th) (Rallying Strike), +1 stanceJPM 6: +1 Man. readied, Firebird stance, Jade Phoenix master, FeatJPM 7: +1 Man. known (7th) (Inferno Blade)JPM 8: Quickening strikeBAB 16; F/R/W: 9/11/11; Casts as Warlock 12 (6d6 blast, 1 Greater invocation)Thoughts on Tome of Battle’s influence on warlocks by LiltGood question, although aside from using generally overpowered abilities or counters to boost defense then I think that the answer is &quot;probably not&quot;.Warlocks don't get the requirements for the only arcane casting PrC of the book, Jade Phoenix Mage, meaning that although the requirements could be grabbed with a dip into another class, it's probably not worth it. Combine this with the fact that they don't get to use the auto-quicken ability (it only works on a spell, not a spell-like), I don't think it's worth it.Maneuvers generally aren't compatible with the warlock's main source of damage, eldritch blast.Some of the counters and boosts could be very useful combined with the warlock's abilities, but as most of the useful counters and boosts are higher level you're stuck with having to know useless strikes in-order to get them. Still, anyone can benefit from white raven tactics.Stances can be useful for anyone, and the +2d6 sneak attack of Assassin’s Stance could be very useful for a warlock who's able to stay invisible all the time. Available through 2 feats by level 12 or a 1-level dip into swordsage at level 9.Generally, although it adds more options for feats, I don't think there's that much opportunity for synergy.The value of becoming an apprentice: by ThinbladeOk, let’s admit it: the d20 system forces us to plan our entire character path at the very beginning. If it didn’t, the CharOp boards wouldn’t exist (or, at least, would be very different). And one of the problems with this is you too-often run into problems getting into the prestige classes you want.Enter Apprentice, a wonderful feat from the Dungeon Master’s Guide II. It’s first-level only, but adds two skills to your class list permanently, and gives you two skill points to spend on them (check with your DM to see if you continue to gain those skill points past level 1), as well as a bonus associated with the skill.This suddenly makes formerly hard-to-enter PrC’s much easier. Examples of mentors and the PrC’s they help with are: Entertainer (Virtuoso), Philosopher or Spellcaster (Keeper of the Cerulean Sign), and Woodsman (Cyran Avenger, Sentinal of Bharri, Swanmay).The drawback is that you need to spend 8 hours each week with your mentor, which can make adventuring hard, and you need to tithe 100 gp to him/her each level.Once you reach level 5, though, things become more interesting. You graduate, don’t need to tithe or work with your mentor, and can turn your Apprentice feat into the Mentor feat, which gets you a 1st level apprentice you design. Your apprentice needs 8 hours of training a week, doesn’t adventure, and gains a level each time you do. When they get to level 5 (your level 10), they graduate and become a cohort. So you essentially get the Leadership feat for a 1st level feat, provided you’re willing to put in the work (pun intended) over ten levels.Itemization for a Warlock by cheezgraterIf I don't list a sourcebook, then it is straight out of the 3.5DMGChasuble of Fell Power - boosts damage from your eldritch blast. Buy this. (Complete Arcane)Warlock's Sceptre - Gives you +2 to hit with ranged touch attacks, and by spending charges you can boost your eldritch blast damage. (Complete Arcane)Cloak of Charisma - Useful instant boost to your save DCs if you use a lot of save-based invocationsGloves of Dexterity - Useful for blaster locks and meleelocks that rely on weapon finesse.Boots of Elvenkind - Warlocks get invisibility invocations. Move silently bonuses can't hurt for those times when sneakiness is the order of the day.Mithral Full-Plate - with the Battlecaster and Medium Armor Proficiency feats, you can get a really nice AC for your warlock, with no spell failure chance. Enchant this for even better armor.Belt of Magnificence - Expensive as all get-out, but boosts all 6 stats while taking up only one slot. IIRC, it's 200,000gp for the +6 version, but +6 to every stat is really nice. (Miniatures handbook)Cloak of Displacement, Minor - all attacks against you have a 20% miss chance. Pretty nice, especially for those warlocks that like to get into melee. This can serve as a replacement for the Entropic Warding invocation (and the item is better since it also works on melee attacks), except that it doesn't make you untrackablePale Green Ioun Stone - +1 on attack rolls, saves, skill checks, and ability checks that doesn't require an item slot? Yes, Please!Orange Ioun Stone - +1 caster level, slotless. Won't give you extra invocations or boost Eldritch Blast damage, but can be useful if you see many enemies with spell resistance.Manuals and Tomes - +5 inherent bonuses to Dex and Charisma are really nice for a blaster. Con is also nice for a melee lock What more needs to be said? You may also want to consider other books if you have money to burn. Beefing up stats is rarely a bad thing.Horizon Goggles by FromTheShadows - I'm surprised nobody really noticed the Horizon Goggles in Complete Mage. For a mere 8,000 gp, you get extra range on your blast or invocations as long as they happen to be in a form that uses a ranged attack roll.Codex Advocare by Tweedledope - Ya'll don't forget the Codex Advocare from the Expedition to Castle Ravenloft. It might seem minor but, for 20k it gives you an extra Least invocation known. Sure beats wastin' a feat.Thoughts on Call of the Beast by ThinbladeThis invocation gives wild empathy, the druid/ranger class feature, and the spell speak with animals. It’s notable because it gives a class feature and not just a spell or ability, and can therefore be used to get into PrC’s that would otherwise be unavailable. So far, the only such class in Swanmay, from the Book of Exalted Deeds.Alternate Class FeaturesFiendish Flamewreath (PHB II) by Lone WolfA replacement for fiendish resilience. Starting at 8th level, 1/day you can immolate yourself in wispy flames that don't hurt you or your gear, but deal 1d6 points of fire damage to any creature that strikes you with its body (I assume this means a natural weapon) or a hand-held weapon. Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this damage if they attack you. Using the ability is a free action, and it lasts 2 minutes or until you take another free action to end it. The flames provide light equivalent to a torch, but can't be extinguished except by you. This is a supernatural ability. At level 13, the damage done increases to 2d6 points of fire damage. At level 18, it increases to 5d6.Venomous Blood (Drow of the Underdark) by Lone WolfThis replaces your Fiendish Resilience at 8th level, and offers a +5 bonus on saves vs. poison; at 13th level, it turns your blood into a poison that affects any creature that bites you or swallows you whole (contact; Fort save DC 10 + 1/2 your warlock level + Cha modifier; 1d3 Str/1d3 Str); and finally at 18th level, allows you to envenom a weapon or your eldritch blast 3/day, with the poison dealing 1d6 Str instead of 1d3. The poison lasts until you make an attack with the weapon or eldritch blast or until the start of your next turn. Does not prevent you from applying blast shape or eldritch essence invocations to your eldritch blast.Simple Warlock Trick - Wall of Gloom, by Tleilaxu_Ghola:&quot;LoSing&quot; Enemies from Allies: Our DM made some wicked charge monsters. Nothing put the kibosh on a charging monster more than this stupid spell. Simply drop the wall in between your party member and the charging monster. The monster will be unable to target your friend, making it impossible for them to charge. To wit:If you don't have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can't charge that opponent.If you cannot see the target (for instance, if you're blind or the target is invisible), you can't have line of sight to it even if you could draw an unblocked line between your space and the target's.It's also a great way to prevent casters from nuking your allies without wasting a move action. Simply sit back, and ready actions to cast another wall of gloom when they finish their move, but before they cast. Even if they move through the wall, you can set up another one in between them and they'll lose LoS, provided they don't appear adjacent to their target (most casters want a bit of space while casting to avoid AoOs).Warlock FeatsMany, many thanks to jameswilliamogle for writing this section. Additions were made by Agent Rasp, and are marked with [AR]. I've added a few feats as well, and those are marked by [TB].Books not in this list: Dragon Magic, Races of the Dragon, Magic of Incarnum, Sandstorm, Frostburn, Complete Psionic, Heroes of Battle, and possibly a few others (so others can jump in and continue).Core FeatsAbility Focus: Eldritch Blast: This is a great filler feat for later levels, when the Warlock gets access to Utterdark Blast in particular. Its worth taking earlier if you focus all your invocations as essences. ***Apprentice [TB] (DMG II): A great feat to get into PrC’s with difficult skill requirements, Apprentice is a first-level-only feat can eventually morph into Leadership, but it requires the DM’s blessing and a lot of work (pun intended). Grants extra skill points, makes cross-class skills class skills, and grants a variety of special bonuses depending on the mentor. I’ve included a larger write-up in the Miscellany section. **/*****Combat Casting [AR]: Some help when casting defensively, but invocations have somatic components and thus can't be attempted in a grapple anyway. High Constitution gives you at least this good a bonus, plus a nice crop of hit points and improved Fortitude, freeing up another feat in the process. Keep up your ranks in Concentration and you'll be fine. *Combat Expertise [AR]: Only really useful for melee-locks, and then only at higher levels or when multiclassed for better BAB. The Int requirement may be a slight problem, depending on how you roll or buy; personally, I'm too much of a skill freak to ever play a 2 + Int class without taking Int 14 (and usually human, too). * / *** (melee-locks)Combat Reflexes [AR]: The advent of eldritch glaive may give some potential to this feat, especially for a melee-lock with good Dexterity; I've got a mental image of Morthos facing a line of armored bruisers and going all Tao Ren as they move in, using a repelling glaive to knock 'em flying and avoid being ground to manburgers next round. However, without Dragon Magic, I'm unclear on the mechanics of the invocation. For warlocks without glaive, the feat isn't worth it. * / ?Empower Spell-Like Ability: I'd only take this if there was absolutely no time for crafting, as the Warlock is very tight on feats. It still can add some ok damage, though. **Flyby Attack: Your invocations and blast takes a standard action to activate, and thus Spring Attack, Shot on the Run, and Ride by Attack won't work with them. Flyby Attack allows you to make a standard action as part of a flying move action, allowing every invocation, blast, and any other standard action, and has no other feat prerequisites. You need to pick up the Fell Flight invocation, or have a flight speed by virtue of race or template (Avorial, Dragonborn, etc).&amp;nbsp;NOTE: Some DM's won't allow you to take this feat because it isn't in the Player's Hanbook, but the Monster Manual is a core book: ask the DM if they'd allow a high level Wizard to take Craft Construct in return. They'll then counter with &quot;you don't have a fly speed all the time&quot; to which you reply &quot;its 24/7!!&quot; and then throw some Cheetos and cans of soda at him. Then find another group. I'd rate this feat higher than Precise Shot even, it's the best you can get. *****+Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes [AR]: Somewhat useful at low levels to bolster your poor Fort and Ref saves, but your Con and Dex should be above-average to high anyway, and items outstrip the feats. Dark one's own luck is a better long-term investment. *Improved Critical (eldritch blast) [AR]: Blast-oriented 'locks should take this feat ASAP (you qualify at 11th level), and others should strongly consider it. It doubles your chances to crit, it applies to all flavors and most forms of eldritch blast (except for cone, doom, and likely line), and you can use it from sunrise to sunset. ****Improved Feint [AR]: With high Charisma, Bluff as a class skill, and the possibility of a bonus from beguiling influence, melee-locks trying to land a hideous blow can get some use out of this feat when facing high-Dexterity opponents. It might also be useful combined with eldritch glaive, which I gather is a melee touch attack, but touch ACs aren't usually very high to begin with, and a warlock already stands a good chance of hitting even if not optimized. Doesn't really seem worth the trouble. **Improved Initiative: This is good on every character, but unless you plan on multiclassing with Rogue or a Rogue-like class, I wouldn't waste the feat slot on it. ***Improved Precise Shot:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;By the time you can take this, you could choose other feats, and your blasts are starting to lose some effectiveness. The concealment reroll ability is nicer than the cover. **Improved Sunder: Melee Warlocks could take this along with the Hammer Blast Invocation. You can do some serious sundering when you need to. The feat itself is more useful as a prelude to Combat Brute. **Leadership:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It’s the most overpowered feat in the game, but even then, you might not want to take it, simply b/c it adds more complexity than you want (one optimized character is enough to handle, for me). An artificer buddy is my favorite cohort (and that’s for every non-artificer character I take). * to ******, depending on how you design the cohort.Point Blank Shot: Mainly useful as a prerequisite for Precise Shot, it gives a +1 to hit and damage when within 30' (Complete Arcane is the source for using feats for Weapon-like effects). Without an item to increase your range, every Blast will have the added damage. ****Thinblade note: It should be noted that there is a long-running and sometimes acrimonious debate regarding the usefulness of Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot, based around the fact that your blasts are touch attacks, and sooner or later you’ll probably only be missing on an auto-fail. The usefullness of these two feats varies extremely between campaigns, builds, the average touch AC of your opponents, and fighting styles. Be warned, your mileage may vary.Power Attack: You can apply the damage from Power Attack to Eldritch Glaive. That includes damage from Leap Attack, too. This is a must have for any Melee Warlock, along with Quicken SLA: Eldritch Glaive (which you use at the end of your charge). The feat is also useful as a prelude to Shocktrooper (although the feat isn’t as necessary with touch attack rolls only). ****Precise Shot: Every time you use Eldritch Blast on an enemy that doesn't die right away you'll have to fire into combat. *****Thinblade note: It should be noted that there is a long-running and sometimes acrimonious debate regarding the usefulness of Point Blank Shot and Precise Shot, based around the fact that your blasts are touch attacks, and sooner or later you’ll probably only be missing on an auto-fail. The usefullness of these two feats varies extremely between campaigns, builds, the average touch AC of your opponents, and fighting styles. Be warned, your mileage may vary.Quicken Spell-Like Ability: Can be used w/ Flee the Scene to great effect as an exit strategy, but also works well as the Teflammar Shadowlord Prestige Class Prerequisite. Also great to use with Eldritch Glaive, as it grants 2 full attacks using that invocation in a single round. Other than these specific invocations, the utility isn't quite as good. ****Skill Focus: UMD: Don't take it on a Warlock; by the time you can create items, your UMD check should be high enough, and the ability to take 10 mitigates low rolls. 0Spell Penetration [AR]: A build with uninterrupted caster level progression can get by (especially if you take penetrating blast), but if you've taken levels in non-caster classes, consider this feat to make up some of the difference against spell resistant foes. Greater Spell Penetration might be a bit much, unless you took a big hit on caster levels or the DM favors massive SR monsters. ***Weapon Focus: Ray: Generally not worth the spent feat, this might be useful as a prerequisite for other feat or Prestige Classes. *Psionic FeatsPsionic Shot:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The basis for most blast-based builds. This is the crown jewel that's used over and over in many builds. It expends your psionic focus, so you'll need to take Psionic Meditation below to be able to use it every round. ****Greater Psionic Shot: Adds more damage to Psionic Shot, but since it takes up another feat slot, not quite as good. ***Psionic Meditation:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Needed by most characters taking Psionic Shot to refocus as a move action. Useful only to these characters. ****Wild Talent:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Necessary in many builds to generate the prereq for Psionic Shot, but also can meet the prereq for Thrallherd if you want to use the sacrificial rules from BoVD to make items. Its useless to anyone else that doesn't use either of these. **Mind Over Body: Only useful for Warlocks that want to take Darkspeech for turning their Summoned Swarms into Hive Minds, and only mildly useful for that (a level of Binder or becoming Undead works much better). *Psionic Weapon, Greater Psionic Weapon:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Similar to Psionic Shot, but is only remotely useful to melee-Warlock builds. Since you have to expend your focus every time you use it, you'll never get a full round of attacks out of it (past 5th level, of course). Not worth the feat slots. *Item Creation:The Warlock gets the ability to create any item that they have the item creation feat with a UMD check. If you plan on making any items when you get the ability, its always better to take Able Learner at 1st level and dip 2 levels of Chameleon, as the 2nd level ability grants any feat you meet the prereq's for 24 hours. If you can't take Chameleon due to the campaign, then here's a quick ranking of the PHB item creation feats:Brew Potion:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Buy them, don't make them. 1/2*Craft Magic Arms And Armor:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;You can wear light armor, after all, and the tank will love you, but generally not as synergistic as the other crafting feats. **Craft Rod:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Not good enough for a feat, but worth it if you burn through Warlock's Scepters often. *+1/2Craft Staff:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;They need to hold at least 2 spells, and many DMs don't allow custom staffs. Even then the fire staff is still cheap for what it does. Add a few 0 level spells along with the real spell you want to keep the cost low for custom staffs. Staffs in general are better than Wands as you can use your Cha to boost the DC. *** without custom staffs, **** with custom staffsCraft Wand:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;By the time you can make them, they're losing utility. Slightly better than Craft Staff if custom staffs aren't allowed. Don't make wands for blasting for yourself: you've got Eldritch Blast. Instead, make useful utility wands. ***+1/2Craft Wondrous Item:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Always decent, but many items are cheap enough to buy. ***+1/2Forge Ring:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Better if you can make custom rings, but usually still sucks. * with custom rings, otherwise 1/2*Scribe Scroll:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A good feat to have, even with Chameleon, as it allows you to scribe any spell in the game in an emergency. ****+1/2Craft Construct:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A Warlock with a bunch of crafting Homonculi and Golems would make for an interesting character, but its just not worth the feat prerequisites to get this. *Craft Contingent Spell (CArc):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Its good on normal casters, so why wouldn’t it work here? There’s nothing like having a Divine Power saved for the first time you enter combat to really kick arse. ***Craft Rune Circle:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;I find the Rune Circles a little expensive to make. Still, there’s some abuses for it. I rate this about equal with Craft Arms and Armor. **Dual Wand Wielder (CArc):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It’s got a bad prereq for Warlocks, although they usually can meet it. You don’t want to rely this heavily on Wands. *Reckless Wand Wielder (CArc), Wand Mastery (Eb):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;You don’t want to rely this much on wands. Just wait until you can make staffs instead. *Magical Artisan, Legendary Artisan, Extraordinary Artisan:&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;These feats are just nominally approved on Artificers, so why would you take them? **Feats from Lords of MadnessAberration Banemagic [TB]: Highly campaign specific and requires DM permission since it doesn’t mention invocations, this can be an AWESOME feat if you’re fighting aberrations with anything like regularity. +2d6 damage and +2 DC with ALL invocations whenever used against aberrations. Stacks with anything else that increases damage or DC, like Vitriolic Blast (though obviously not Moralbane). Especially useful with area effects, like Chilling Tentacles. ** / ***** (depending on how often you fight aberrations)Aberration Blood [Aberrant]* [AR]: The &quot;gateway&quot; Aberrant feat. On its own, it's Skill Focus with an associated deformity, and not really much use to a warlock. Skip it unless you intend to take more Aberrant feats. *Bestial Hide [Aberrant] [AR]: The fact that the natural armor bonus increases as you take more Aberrant feats is nice, but it costs too much for a warlock to find useful. *Deepspawn [Aberrant] [AR]: Yay, tentacles! But seriously, three feats for two low-damage tentacle attacks and a small grapple bonus is so-so at best; you're better off with chilling tentacles. ** / **** (if you like tentacles)Durable Form [Aberrant] [AR]: Gaining extra hit points as you take more Aberrant feats isn't a bad deal, but Improved Toughness is worth more in the long run. **Inhuman Reach [Aberrant] [AR]: Eldritch blast and eldritch glaive are vastly better ways to reach out and touch somebody. 0Inhuman Vision [Aberrant] [AR]: All-seeing eyes beats the heck out of the Spot bonus; ditto for devil's sight or see the unseen and the short-range darkvision. 0Parrying Shield [AR]: No help for warlocks unless they've gained shield proficiency, but VERY useful for characters with a good shield bonus and poor touch AC. 0 for normal warlock / **** if you can use a shieldQuick Recovery [AR]: The ability to throw off stunning and dazing effects is very nice, especially since you can try to shake off effects that didn't allow a save when they occurred. ****Scavenging Gullet [Aberrant] [AR]: The bonus vs ingested poisons and diseases is appropriate for the (ahem) flavor of the feat, but I've never been in a situation where it would have helped. *Starspawn [Aberrant] [AR]: Limited flight, minor cold resistance, and immunity to some conditions caused by high altitude is a so-so bonus for having to give up three feats. Fell flight is better. *Warped Mind [Aberrant] [AR]: The Force of Personality feat from Complete Adventurer gives you the same sort of bonus on Will saves, but more of it, and all up-front. Extra psionic power points are pointless for a warlock. 0Waterspawn [Aberrant] [AR]: Swimming the Styx will give you all the benefits of this feat except for the slight cold resistance. 0&amp;nbsp;* The Aberrant feats work best if you take them for thematic reasons rather than mechanical ones. Although intended to reflect a character's (distant) aberration ancestry, they could be used to show a fiendish origin instead.Feats from Heroes of HorrorBlood Calls to Blood [AR]: This fiend-focused feat is right up the warlock's alley in terms of flavor and function; the only catch is deciding whether or not warlocks qualify as spontaneous arcane spellcasters. If you're in a fiend-heavy campaign, see if you can get the DM to fudge the prereqs a bit. ****Debilitating Strike [Tainted]* [AR]: This one could be useful for a melee-lock who wants to maul good outsiders and other DR/evil opponents. The ability to damage Constitution and/or Wisdom is nice, too, but the limited uses per day could be a serious hindrance, if they apply to the entire feat and not just the ability damage. ***Disease Immunity [AR]: If your DM likes biowarfare and cure disease is scarce, this feat can help you and your entire party. Taking it more than once would be overdoing it, though. **Dreamtelling [AR]: This feat is useless unless the DM has introduced a &quot;dream world&quot; into the campaign. If that's the case, it's handy for dealing with the related weirdness, especially since Knowledge (the planes) is a class skill for warlocks. Not the greatest warlock feat overall, however. 0 or ***Font of Life [AR]: If energy-draining enemies are anything like common in your campaign world, take this feat. The ability to shrug off a negative level the moment you get it is godly. *****Lunatic Insight [Tainted]* [AR]: Use all Knowledge skills untrained, plus get a modest initiative bonus and a save bonus vs mind-affecting effects. Not bad. ***Master of Knowledge [AR]: A flat bonus to all Knowledge checks. Not really that good unless you can use all the Knowledge skills. **Pure Soul* [AR]: A nice way to avoid physical degeneration and insanity without paying for magical treatment. True, a warlock in a horror campaign should be the one most susceptible to the effects of taint, but the idea of the opposite being true -that the cleric and paladin fall prey to ever-increasing corruption and depravity while the warlock remains unaffected- is darkly amusing. *****Spirit Sense [AR]: You see dead people. Cheap movie references aside, the bonus to Spot incorporeal creatures is somewhat useful; last I checked, however, such beasties were silent unless they wanted to be heard, making Listen checks (and bonuses thereof) rather irrelevant. The short time-frame for seeing recently dead spirits seems kind of useless too. **Surge of Malevolence [Tainted]* [AR]: This is like a variant of action points, and it only gets more effective as you turn more corrupt or depraved. Too bad it's only once per day. **Tainted Fury [Tainted]* [AR]: Gain extra hit points, make a smite attack, and risk Con damage at the end of the rage-like period. A warlock can find use for this feat whether he favors melee or has been dragged into it against his will, but the post-fury hp loss and Con damage is something to watch out for. ****Unnatural Will [AR]: Charisma modifier + Wisdom modifier on Will saves vs fear? Interesting thought, but I'd rather just take Force of Personality (again), and free up the feat that would have gone to Iron Will. *&amp;nbsp;* Pure Soul and the Tainted feats are useless if the rules for taint aren't in effect.Feats from Complete MageBattlecaster Defense [Tactical] [AR]: This feat specifies the casting of spells, but could be converted for a warlock's use with no pain at all, beyond the Combat Casting requirement. ***Battlecaster Offense [Tactical] [AR]: The flip side of the previous feat, just not as useful. Same caveats. **Delay Potion [AR]: The only reason I'd take this feat would be so I could walk around with a cure spell in reserve. Since warlocks can manage just as well with UMD, why bother? *Favored Magic Foe [AR]: A little narrow, but not entirely poor. Your class skill list allows you to meet the requirements for several common enemy types. ***Magic Device Attunement [AR]: Being able to activate one magical item without further UMD checks sounds nice in theory (especially since you can switch your attunement to a different item), but in practice, no warlock should be worried about failing UMD checks. **Master of Undeath [AR]: This is a great feat for a warlock with the dead walk, provided that you can find sufficiently big, powerful, and dead creatures to reanimate. Or you can animate one big bruiser and a lot of lesser troops; either way is good, and if you do things right, it's unlikely that the big guy will survive long enough to break free and eat your brains. Mmmm. Brains. 0 without the dead walk / **** withFeats Tome of MagicBind Vestige [AR]: Bind one of five vestiges and gain a minor supernatural power for up to 24 hours. Sort of like Extra Invocation, except that the powers are only interrupted by antimagic, and you can bind a different vestige each day. The powers themselves aren't much to speak of except at low levels; thematically, though, this is the sort of ability a warlock would be expected to have. ***Defense Against the Supernatural [AR]: An insight bonus on saves vs supernatural special attacks. If you run into such things often, it'll help; if not, skip it. **Empower, Enlarge, Extend, and Quicken Utterance [AR]: Unless you multiclass as a truenamer, you burn far too many feats just qualifying for these. 0Empower, Enlarge, Extend, and Widen Supernatural Ability [AR]: None of these are helpful to a warlock, even if he has Bind Vestige. A binder/warlock might find them useful. 0Focused Lexicon [AR]: Too narrowly focused to be useful to anyone without binder levels. 0Improved Bind Vestige [AR]: Opens up eight new supernatural powers you can gain by binding a vestige. They're a bit better than the previous ones. ***Minor Utterance of the Evolving Mind [AR]: Choose one of four 1st-level utterances, each of which is equivalent to two spells. You have to spend 12 skill points or 6 points and a feat to get this, but some of the utterances are pretty useful. ***Obscure Personal Truename [AR]: A minor benefit, useful vs enemy truenamers. The notion that your truename is somehow protected (perhaps by the pact that gives you eldritch power) is thematically appealing. Having to spend 12 skill points or 6 skill points and another feat is too rich for this, though. **Personal Truename Backlash [AR]: The effect is interesting, but minor for something you can only gain at 15th level or higher. By this point, you have better things to spend feats on. *Practiced Binder [AR]: You gain two abilities for binding a vestige. Combine with Improved Bind Vestige and you can obtain some useful abilities, but really not enough for burning three feats. **Sudden Ability Focus [AR]: Once per day, you add the benefit of Ability Focus to any one special attack you have. It stacks with regular Ability Focus, and you can take it multiple times for extra uses. Nifty. ***Supernatural Crusader [AR]: The offensive version of Defense Against the Supernatural. About as useful. **Supernatural Opportunist [AR]: Gain a sneak attack against threatened enemies that use a supernatural ability. You need Supernatural Crusader as a prereq. Not that helpful for a warlock. *Truename Research [AR]: The effect of this feat is too specialized to be useful for any warlock who doesn't have ranks of truenamer. 0Truename Training [AR]: Truespeak becomes a class skill. Doesn't help warlocks at all, except to make feats with Truespeak rank prereqs easier to afford. *Utterance of the Crafted Tool, the Evolving Mind, and the Perfected Map [AR]: The utterances you can pick up from these feats are handy, but the prereqs are just too costly for a warlock. *Other FeatsAble Learner (RoD): Mainly useful as a prerequisite for Chameleon, which will give some great diversity to the Warlock. If you plan on multi-classing a lot, it’s a great feat, but otherwise just meh. I don’t consider it worth taking if you don’t plan on getting into Chameleon. **Battlecaster (CA):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Most useful to Melee Warlocks, who can use it to wear Mithril Fullplate. Usually they don’t have as many free feats for it, though. ***Combat Brute (CWar):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;As Shocktrooper; generally Shocktrooper is taken before this feat. ***Dark Speech (Hordes of the Abyss):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This feat breaks the game (Elephant Jack made this discovery). You can use it with Summon Swarm to generate a Sorcerer that can cast 6th level spells immediately, that can summon more powerful swarms to generate a chain of more and more powerful casters, all under your control (if you do it right). Expect to get chips and soda in your hair after you come to the table with this. *****+++ (broke, as in beyond Druid broke)Defensive Archery (RotW):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A feat to give +4 AC when provoking with a ranged attack? It might be useful for a few levels when your damage is actually worth a damn, but not worth the slot in the long run. *Diving Charge (RotW):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;+2d6 damage when charging from flying. Neat for Melee Warlocks, it still would be a tight fit to put this in a standard build. **Extraordinary Spell Aim (CAdv):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Many DM’s won’t allow you to use this, as your Invocations aren’t spells. It’s a nice feat if they do allow it, as it allows you to nicely manipulate your Chilling Touch effects. **Extra Invocation (CA):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A great feat if you have room for it. Generally better to take after you have access to Greater and Dark Invocations. ****Frightful Presence (Draconomicon):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A nice Cha-synergy effect for Melee Warlocks. Only works on charges, but the DC is cha based. I’d add it after a few other charging feats. ***Leap Attack (CAdv):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;See Power Attack above. Very useful to Melee Warlocks. ***+1/2Maximize Spell-like Ability (CA):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The main advantage of this feat is that it makes your Eldritch Blast easier to use in combat at higher level (you don’t have to count as many die). Not really worth the feat slot. ***Mobile Spellcasting (CAdv):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Don’t take this if you have access to Flyby Attack. It also specifies spells, not SLAs so you need DM fiat to make it work. You do get more movement out of this than Flyby Attack, normally, though. ***Mortalbane (BoVD):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;An extra 2d6 damage to anything not a Construct or Undead or Outsider, and 1/2 to them. If allowed (it’s 3.0), better than Psionic Shot simply because it doesn’t require a power point reserve, psionic focus, or a prereq feat. *****Neraph Charge (PlH):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This is a very useful feat for Rogue / Warlocks that want to melee. Its not horrid on Melee Warlocks, as it renders the opponents you charge flat-footed. Theres worse ways to spend a feat. *+1/2Plunging Shot (RotW):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Another +d6 damage feat if you fly. I have nothing else to say about it. **Shocktrooper (CWar):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Melee Warlocks will find it useful, for obvious reasons, but not surprisingly, its not as useful as in normal melee builds since you only have to roll touch attacks. The prereq feat, Imp Bull Rush, isn’t quite that useful. ***Tomb-tainted Soul (LM):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;You can heal with an Utterdark Blast, but by the time you get that, its not worth taking. Just become a Necropolitan instead for the same effect. *Undead Leadership (LM):&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;See Leadership above. * to *****Epic Feats and Invocations by jameswilliamogleNOTE: Epic feats are only rated with * relative to each other; obviously, any of these would be better than the non-epic feats above.Dark Transient: Teleportation and Plane Shift, improved. Not a bad feat, but there are better for an epic feat, and Shadow Walk can imitate what this feat provides, somewhat. The invocation prereq's are not unreasonable to obtain, but can almost do what the feat allows. Dedicated Arcane Spellcasters are how you travel, not the Warlock. **Eldritch Sculptor: Use two eldritch blasts at double range with a +2 to hit still as a standard action, and can be combined w/ Master of Elements below. A great epic feat. Very reasonable prereq's, too. ****Epic Eldritch Blast: Extra d6 damage with your blast. As everyone knows, HP expand much faster than CR. This is a feat to be taken only when you have a few of the others. *Epic Extra Invocation: An extra Dark Invocation is great, but at Epic levels, you should have a fairly well defined invocation list. More useful to meet the prereq's for other Epic feats. ***&amp;nbsp;Epic Fiendish Resilience: An extra fast healing 5 each time you take the feat is ok, but you still can only use it once per day. I would take this feat over Epic Eldritch Blast, but not over many of the other Epic feats. It could be useful for Melee Warlocks, if you are doing that. *+1/2Lord of All Essences: Double essences on your blasts. Another awesome feat, particularly if you built your Warlock to really focus on essences up to that point. Eldritch Sculptor is still better, but in certain builds this could be just as good. Easy Prereq's. ***+1/2Master of the Elements: Summoning is cool, and dominating elementals is cool, and extra energy resistance is cool, but I just don't think its as good as a few of the other feats. It makes for a nice filler feat, but I wouldn't take it unless you already had the 2 cruddy invocation prereq's. **Morpheme Savant: You get Tongues, a monster bonus from Beguiling Influence, and can use a Suggestion if you know the creature you are suggesting, and over any plane, with no limit on the amount of times you can use it (as normal) with reduced activation time. Think about it: every non-deific creature will roll a 1 eventually. Keep suggesting to that Efreeti the Wizard just gated that it grants you 3 wishes until it does. The last ability is worth it. You really only have to take 1 crappy invocation to get this. ****Paragon Visionary: Its like permanent True Sight, but better. The invocations required aren't horrid, but the overall package is a little weak for Epic. ***Shadowmaster: This is the OMG feat in epic. Its like gaining every 8th level and lower Conjuration spell as its own invocation. All the required Invocations are weak, but this feat makes up for it completely. *****+Souleater Incarnate: Combine with a bag of rats, and then animate them, and you can get ridiculous +X to saves and attacks. Since it seems the Incarnum invocations aren't that good, however, I'd say pass on this one except for in a few builds that actually are focused on Incarnum. Melee Warlocks may be able to get some really nice advantages out of this one, though. **Verminlord: You take Darkspeech (Hordes of the Abyss) and then focus on getting this feat. Dominate Monster (Vermin), makes your swarms pass up a little more DR (but not Epic DR), and increases the poison save for centipedes (which normal Warlocks can't usually get). Reasonable prereq invocations, too. Definitely not as powerful as Shadowmaster, All Essences, Morpheme, or Sculptor. ***CONCLUSIONS: Get Shadowmaster, Morpheme Savant, Eldritch Sculptor, and Lord of All Essences, in that order of importance. Avoid Epic Fiendish Resilience and Epic Eldritch Blast. Take Epic Extra Invocation to meet the prereq's you don't have for Shadowmaster or Morpheme.Basic BuildsThis isn’t every build here on the boards, but it feels like it .

Some people go for rogue 3 for evasion and more skills and also take the 6th level in shadowlord for the death attack, but I think this build is more exact.&amp;nbsp;The invocations I would take are:Least: Hideous Blow, See the Unseen, Baleful UtteranceLesser: Flee the Scene, Walk Unseen, Fell FlightGreater: Devour Magic, Vitriolic Blast&amp;nbsp;I am avoiding blast shapes mostly because this is a melee build. I've actually considered enervating shadow, but I just don't think it's worth if, even for a melee build that moves around constantly.Various Builds from Mommy was an OrcI like the following Warlock builds:Rogue 1/Warlock 12/Daggerspell Mage 7 - +3d6 Sneak, 18th level Warlock, still gets Imbue Item.

All you need to do is wait for someone in your party to get hp damaged to use it.You could also swap out the Psychic Warrior level for Fighter (16 bab), Rogue, Changeling Rogue, Mindbender, or anything else your party needs to help this fit in.The Eldritch TheUr-Lock by NatchFeralWarlock 9/Ur-Priest 2/Eldritch Disciple 9Abilities:Invocations as Warlock 18 (2 Dark Invocations)Cleric Spells as Ur-Priest 10 (9th level cleric spells)Rebuke UndeadBAB +13Saves: +6/+6/+15Variant: Warlock 8/Ur-Priest 2/Eldritch Disciple 8/Chameleon 2Abilities:Invocations as Warlock 16 (1 Dark Invocation)Cleric Spells as Ur-Priest 10 (9th level cleric spells)Rebuke UndeadBAB +14Mystic Wanderer (MoF) is a nice 2 level dip, as well.

Boosting caster level will get you 4-5 clones. All can use the Warlock Invocations. Multiple uses of Miracle can get you up to 30 clones. The Chameleon floating feat can allow the clones to customize themselves with Extra Invocation. Astral Projection can net lots of duplicate equipment for your clones to use.-Make any magic item in the game aside from golems (Variant Build)Tricklock by leif008I figured out one easy way for a Rogue/Warlock to meet the requirements for the Arcane Trickster Prc since it only requires the ability to cast 2 spells which can be met by spell-like abilities (pg 72 Carc). Mage hand is gained from the Spell hand feat, and the ability to cast Daylight gained from the Aasimar race which is a 3rd level arcane spell.Aasimar +2 Cha, +2 WisThe build is a ranged Aasimar warlock using sneak attack. I've listed the build with the +1 ECL paid off. The way to ultimately munchkin out the character is to add the Dark Creature Template, so he gains +10 movement speed, 10 cold resistance, and the coveted Hide in Plain Sight ability. Surprise round Sneak Attack Eldritch Blast, next turn: Move + hide in plain sight, fire off a Sneak Attack Eldritch Blast, etc. If you wind up using the Dark Creature Template switch out Walk Unseen, Miasmic Cloud, Retributive Invisibility, and Nightmares Made Real for invocations that aren't redundant in purpose.My group always plays with bonus feats gained every odd level but we don't play with flaws. So if you play with the standard feat progression remove some extra invocations.&amp;nbsp;[01] Rogue 1 [Craven] - Sneak Attack 1d6, Trapfinding[02] Warlock 1 - Eldritch Blast 1d6, Least: Miasmic Cloud[03] Warlock 2 [Precise Shot] - Detect Magic, Least: Dark One's Luck[04] Rogue 2 - Evasion[05] Warlock 3 [Practiced Spellcaster] - Eldritch Blast 2d6, DR 1/Cold Iron[06] Rogue 3 - Sneak Attack 2d6, Trap Sense +1[07] Arcane Trickster 1 [Spell Hand] - Ranged Legerdemain 1/day, Least: Eldritch Spear[08] Arcane Trickster 2 - Sneak Attack 3d6, Eldritch Blast 3d6[09] Arcane Trickster 3 [Maximize SLA] - Impromptu Sneak Attack 1/day, Lesser: Fell Flight[10] Arcane Trickster 4 - Sneak Attack 4d6, Eldritch Blast 4d6[11] Arcane Trickster 5 [Empower SLA] - Lesser: Walk Unseen, switch Miasmic Cloud to Baleful Utterance, Ranged Legerdemain 2/day[12] Arcane Trickster 6 - Sneak Attack 5d6, Eldritch Blast 5d6[13] Arcane Trickster 7 [Quicken SLA] - Impromptu Sneak Attack 2/day, Lesser: Eldritch Chain[14] Arcane Trickster 8 - Sneak Attack 6d6, Eldritch Blast 6d6, Greater: Nightmares Made Real, Switch out Walk Unseen for Flee the Scene[15] Arcane Trickster 9 [Extra Invocation: Least or Lesser] - Ranged Legerdemain 3/day[16] Arcane Trickster 10 - Sneak Attack 7d6, Greater: Vitriolic Blast[17] Warlock 4 [Extra Invocation: Least or Lesser] - Deceive Item, Eldritch Blast 7d6, Greater: Vitriolic Blast[18] Rogue 4 - Uncanny Dodge[19] Warlock 5 [Extra Invocation: Least or Lesser] - Greater: Eldritch Cone[20] Warlock 6 - Dark: Retributive InvisibilityOz the Singing Warlock by NatchFeralOkay, here is an Eldritch Theurge build, since I've had so much fun with the Eldritch Disciple...BuildBard 1 (Precocious Apprentice, Sanctum Spell)Warlock 8Eldritch Theurge 1Sublime Chord 1Eldritch Theurge 2-10Benefits:9th level sublime chord spellsInvocations as Warlock 18Able to cast all spells in light armor.DR 4/cold ironFiendish Resiliance 2SpellblastGreatreach BlastVariations:Warlock levels 5-8 could be any prestige class that advances warlock casting, so Mindbender, Blood Magus, etc. could be added. Chameleon 2 would still allow for a single Dark Invocation. Binder 1 could substitute for a Warlock level, then Anima Mage at level 3, provided Improved Binding is taken as the level 3 feat. Use Anima Mage 6 to replace the remaining Warlock levels, advancing both Warlock Invocations and Binding. That gives access to 4th level vestiges.&amp;nbsp;Tricks:Nothing special, aside from the easy entry into Sublime Chord. All of the other Warlock tricks still apply to this build, especially if Extra Spell can nab Body out of Body.The No Save One Hit Wonder Warlock: by HoshiAdamWarlock3 /Wizard3 /Eldritch Theurge10 /Spellsword 4&amp;nbsp;13th level Warlock invocations&amp;nbsp;15th level Wizard spellcasting&amp;nbsp;Channel spell 3/dayInvocations of note:Hideous BlowGreater Spellreach (from Eldritch Theurge)Feats of note:Practiced Spellcaster (Wizard)Practiced Spellcaster (Warlock, to boost versus SR)Anything to increase Evocation or Cold caster level by 1Wild TalentPsionic WeaponGreater Psionic WeaponEquipment of note:Spellstoring weapon of some kindGreater Chaucible of Fell Power - +2d6 Eldritch BlastCast a Scorching Ray into the weapon (12d6)Channel a Polar Ray into the weapon (20d6 if there is a boost to cold or evocation)In combat, cast a True Strike, then move to within 10' of an opponent.

Enough to max out 8 skills.Eldritch Disciple by NatchFeralBoED/Vow of Poverty will get you treat your Eldritch Blast as a +5/good-aligned weapon.

This would be a nasty combo even though damage was reduced. Charge w/massive damage, and then dimension-door out of the range in the same round).If you pump up your Charisma as well as Strength, Repelling Blast could make this even nastier (Charge with damage, Reflex save or victim is blown backwards and knocked prone).So when you start grabbing buffs, you could dish out some severe damage with a meleelock!Warlock/Wizard/Cleric by LiamDeclan(End result is a cleric of 7/ Wizard of 11/ Warlock of 18)To get the most out of what you want you can try this little trick.Take the Illumian race from Races of Destiny, choose the krau sigil as one of your racial abilities.Start off with this Cleric 1/Wizard 1/Warlock 1&amp;nbsp;Now for feats at first level take the Improved Power Sigil Krau feat (also in Races of Destiny) this feat allows you to choose any 2 spells and from that point on they are cast at 1 spell level higher than their actual level. You can change the spells selected at anytime you gain new spells. So when you gain that wizard level choose 1 of the arcane spells along with 1 of your divine spells. Now you can cast 2nd level arcane and divine spells.Okay now we have 3 character levels and the ability to cast 2nd level arcaneine spells getting you into Mystic Theurge.Further your character progression by doing this:Cleric 1/Wizard 1/Warlock 1/Mystic Theurge 2Use the mystic to up your Cleric and Warlock levels.Now you further the progression by going into Eldritch Theurge and Eldritch DiscipleCleric 1/Wizard 1/Warlock 1/Mystic 2/Eldritch Theurge 10/Eldritch Disciple 5So end result is a cleric of 7/ Wizard of 11/ Warlock of 18You can do the same with Sorcerer and you would have a Sorcerer of 10 losing that 6th level spell that a Wizard would have had.Vituoso by VaingloryHuman Paragon 3/Warlock 7/Virtoso 10&amp;nbsp;Gives 2 dark invocations, 8d6 blast, +2 Charisma and lots of bard song goodies.

Full range dimension door, and you may not have flee the scene at this point. Summon Nature Ally V is useful at any level, and it's not like you can't find a use of confusion 1/day.Fey Power, Plus on DC to warlock invocations, doesn't affect blast but still very nice.Fey Presence, 6th, Charm Monster, Deep Slumber, Disguise self...An extra charm when it works, can always use charm monster on your friendly creature then run around casting the invocation on new mobs. Deep Slumber and Disguise have a lot of uses.Fey Skin, basically 1/cold iron DR per feat here that explicitily stacks with the warlock ability. 4 of these feats by level 7 would give you 6/cold iron DR...not bad for the level.The Hellfire Champion by GraveWarlock 6/Anarch 2 (variant Paladin)/Mindbender 1/Hellfire Warlock 3/Legacy Champion 8Warlock lvl: 16+7d6 Eldritch Damage+18d6 Hellfire.As has been pointed out, using Shape Soulmeld (Strongheart Vest) negates the one downside to Hellfire use (aside from those that arise from rp -- pitch wielding mobs--ahem). Another 2 feats to pick up are Mindsight (gotta love Telepathy) and Mortalbane (this one actually fits flavor-wise). The inclusion of Anarch was mainly for Cha to saves (and as an upside, I think can be easily made to fit flavor-wise). Granted, this build hinges on allowing Legacy Champion to further progress Hellfire Warlock, which I think it would as it only increase class features and effective level (but not actual level so epic need not apply). Sure, the Legacy Champion is rather subpar, but in this instance, even with all its useless legacy abilities the fact that it provides a net damage increase of +18d6 untyped and furthers Warlock invocations and EB makes it worth it.When I get some time, I'll post a full build, and also report on it's playability (new 12th campaign starting soon).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Grave &amp;amp; Co.Grave note: Anarch is from Dragon #310. It's full of variant paladin classes for every alignment type. My DM generally allows them all as it does make sense that the other alignments would have some form of champion. If that doesn't fly, you could always drop the Mindbender level and use the Paladin of Freedom variant for Divine Grace. Course, this assumes you want to be good.As for Legacy Champion, if you don't want to eat the usually high penalties associated with your legacy item, you can always just ignore it and not unlock squat.&amp;nbsp;Paragnostic Eldritch Disciple by carnivoreGray ElfChaotic GoodPatron: EhlonnaWarlock 2/ Cloistered Cleric(spontaneous Domain caster variant: Healing) 3/ Eldritch Disciple 10/ Paragnostic Apostle 4/ Contemplative 1Domains:Healing:.cast any Healing Domain spell SpontaneouslyCelerity: gives Time Stop, Greater Blink, HasteAnimal: gives ShapechangeKnowledge: lots of info gathering powerSpell Casting:Caster level 17th(20th with Practiced Caster)9th level Divine SpellsTurn Undead:Base Turn Undead(without items):as 17th lvl Cleric +2(paragnostic apostle:See thru the Veil)= 19th lvl Cleric12th lvl Warlock:Invocations:Least:Eldritch Spear.........250' range EBBeguiling Influence....+6 Bluff, Diplomacy, IntimidateAll Seeing Eyes.........+6 Search, Spot, and Continuous Comprehend LanguagesLesser:Eldritch Chain.........3 targetsVoracious Dispelling..Dispel Magic and Damage targetFell Flight................24 hour FlightGreater:Chilling Tentacles.......Evards Tentacles with Cold damageWhat makes this fun and powerful: the Class Ability: Gift of the Divine.

With his recent piece on sorcerers, Solo leaves his personal touch on the field of optimization. At last, a guide to sorcerers worth reading!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The folks at the Wizards forums need their own copy of this for their optimization library. Last I checked, there was almost nothing in the way of sorcerer optimization to be found there, and most inquiries were directed to Logic Ninja's guide. Which, while helpful, was not as appropriate as this guide is.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;-Chronicled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&quot;To James Solomon Ozymandias, Archmage: We at Heffelman's Department of Arcane Studies Review would like to offer you our heartfelt congratulations.

Thus, I have decided to pass on the summation of my experiences as a sorcerer on to the next generation of magic users so that you may profit by my wisdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Now, I am here to advise, not dictate, the general course of action for sorcerers, such as myself, who wish to attain ultimate arcane power. After all, while it is easier to teach a man what to think than to teach him how to think, the man who knows how to think will eventually triumph over the man who knows what to think.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I shall lay before you the general philosophies I have pursued and found true during my time on the Mortal Coil, and let you judge their worth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Who we are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;We sorcerers are a different breed from other magic users; our powers come neither from pacts made with divine beings, nor from hours of rigorous study in musty libraries, but from within ourselves. It is ours, utterly and completely, from birth till death. It is one of the few things in this world that we can truly call our own.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;When developing such powers, I have seen many young sorcerers make the choice of choosing flash over substance, such as the late Dalron Brogue, Evoker – a powerful man, who’s magic had several crippling weaknesses. He focused too much on Evocation magic and consequently was without the flexibility and adaptability necessary to survive in this dangerous world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;When we sorcerers learn our spells, it is a process of self discovery: we become so familiar with the powers we develop that we can call upon them many more times a day than wizards, but at a price, for we cannot change ourselves (and thus, our known spells) as readily as they can open their tomes. Therefore, a successful sorcerer, in my opinion, should seek to learn for himself spells that will be of use in many different situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;This way, we need not spend time lamenting over the fact that we did not prepare the correct spells for the day, but instead are assured that there will always be something for us to do. Whereas a wizard must carefully prepare his spells, guessing as to what new challenges await him every day, and at the mercy of the smallest error in judgment, a properly versatile sorcerer will be able to go into any situation presented to him with confidence, for he will always know a useful spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;More than just spelling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Obviously, spells do not make the man – nor, as my wife will no doubt remind me, the woman. There is a whole world of training outside of the mere spellcasting that will be critical to a sorcerer’s success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For example, it is imperative that a sorcerer learn how to utilize metamagic in order to improve the potency of his spells; my personal preferences led me to choose Heighten, Empower, Extend, and Silent spell, as they allowed me to make it more difficult for an enemy to resist my spells, cause more damage, have my abjurations endure for longer than normal, and cast spells unobtrusively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course, I made sure to learn the art of casting spells while eschewing simple material components for the sake of self sufficiency, and studied Spellcraft extensively, as well as gaining degrees in Spell Focus for the schools of Illusion and Transmutation from the Institute of Arcane Studies – mainly so I could full the pre-requisites for graduating as an Archmage and learning even more arcane secrets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Notable among those arcane secrets are the abilities to cast spells as a caster of a higher level, being able to turn a touch spell into a ranged touch spell, sculpting area of effect spells to exclude allies, spontaneously altering the energy type of a spell, and increased potency in the ability to counterspell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Good times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Interacting with the world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Speaking of “good times”, it seems a given that we sorcerers always seem to – by the fault of our own or others – attract attention, sometimes unpleasant, often unwanted, you will likely want to invest heavily in the skill of lying. I cannot tell you how many orcs, ogre chieftains, or mercenaries I have had to face in my life, and bluffing my way out of the sticky situations has proven to be an excellent alternative to spells, for they leave fewer enemies, dead bodies, and trail for later trackers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Knowledge of the Arcane and Spellcraft are, of course, nearly mandatory subjects to master, as sorcerers, by definition, will dabble extensively in mysteries of the magic, both to develop their own powers and to understand the secrets of others. As the old saying goes, if you know your enemy and yourself, you will be assured victory in even a hundred battles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Even though most of us have neither the time nor strength to devote to melee combat, I would advise any sorcerer to lean, at the least, how to cast a spell while defending himself against an attacker, for you cannot always expect to have a ally guarding you while you rain magical death down upon your foes. It sucks to be attacked by something, and you should make every preparation against it, but the real world is not fair, and you will find yourself alone and under attack by some hostile force despite your best plans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Prepare for it well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Managing by yourself&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;While on the topic of being alone, it would be wise of you to consider how to balance self sufficiency with interdependence. It has been my principal to make sure that, without any magical gear of any sort, I would, with my bare hands and the arcane powers within me, be able to perform my magics without hindrance, as I fully anticipate not being with, or running out of, material components and focuses for spells, or having my items stolen, dispelled, or disjunctioned. It is, after all, absurd to expect that a worthy opponent will not try to separate you from your spell components, focuses, items, and, for wizards, spell books.Thus, I would advise you to use magic items to compliment your spells known, but never to have a magic item compensate for a hole in your magic. The outsourcing of a critical component has caused more than one company and nation woe, and it would behoove you not to repeat the mistake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;(An aside: one of the most hilarious moments in my entire career was when I bluffed one of my first adventuring parties and our antagonist into thinking that I was a wizard, lugging around a huge spellbook and all, filled with runes. When he separated me fromthe spellbook after a long fight during which all my spells had been exhausted, he made the mistake of allowing me to rest for a night before coming in to wave the captured spellbook in my face and taunt me about it. Needless to say, the Empowered Magic Missile I delivered to his face came as a complete surprise.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It doesn't have to be lonely at the top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I have now written at length of the necessity of being self sufficient; but I must tell you of the need for co-operation and collaboration with your peers, for truly, no man is an island.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;To compensate for our weaknesses and shortcomings, such as the inability to “mix it up with the best of them”, kick down doors, heal the wounded, and turn the undead, it would be a prudent decision to associate with those who can, thereby forming a team, whose intraparty synergy will hopefully create a force that is more than the sum of its parts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;In my most recent misadventure, I was accompanied by two great warriors and a powerful cleric, all of whom helped me accomplish tasks and overcome difficulties that I would never have been able to pass by myself. I am deeply indebted to all of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;That being said, the ideal associates you will be working with should include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;• At least one healer who won't need babysitting in combat. I favor clerics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;• A scout or “sneaky” type of character for scouting and reconnaissance. As they will often get into danger above their heads, I favor interns. Scantily clad, leather wearing, busy, female interns...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;• A dedicated combat type - perhaps a druid or another cleric, though my cousin Saal the Barbarian, knows no magic yet breaks skulls well enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;• Perhaps another sorcerer, or wizard, to compensate for your lack of spells known and additional ways to rain magical death down upon your enemies. Or a bard, if he can sing really well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Oddly enough, the entire party of diverse individuals will often be recruited from a local drinking establishment. Why this is so, I have no idea, but that is how the world works.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I digress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;What you do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;As you can see, everyone has a role. Clerics heal, fighters fight, sneaks sneak, bards sing, and monks run really quickly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;But what of your role? What do you contribute to the party?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Well, as a sorcerer, your job is to “cast the spells that makes the peoples fall down!”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;With your ability to cast many spells, you can afford to hex, curse, or blast at the enemy over and over until he is incapacitated, crippled, or dead. This is what you bring to the party; the ability to control and dominate the enemy with gratuitous amounts of magic, making it easier for your side to win the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course, this is all theory; what works best for you should be decided by yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And wouldn’t you know it, I’ve come back to the issue of your known spells again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;As I do not think this repertoire of wisdom would be complete without at least a brief rundown of the best spells available to you as a sorcerer, I shall give you my personal list of spells known and other candidates that you may want to consider depending on your personal style.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;First off, you must decide which schools to select spells from. The general answer is “All of them!”, but you will want to focus more heavily on some schools than others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Conjuration is a great general purpose school, with a bit of everything, so it is always useful to select spells from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Enchantment is the school for crippling your opponent with hexes and curses, while bending them to your will… pity it is stopped stone cold by Mind Blank and the humble Protection from X spells. Don’t get me started on how useless an Enchanter is against undead.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It is, however, a great school for buffing – if that’s your thing. Best left to bards or clerics if you ask me - and does have some good spells such as Feeblemind, Sleep, and Dominate Monster. Enchantment is tempting to some mages due to the fact that it makes having your way with others easier – in many senses of the word.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;These people were what Evan’s Spiked Tentacles of Forced Intrusion was invented for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Evocation is the “hammer” of magic schools. While flashy and impressive, all it takes is one protection from energy spell to render you more useless than the Elvish translation of &quot;How to speak Elvish&quot;. There are some good spells in it, such as Contingency, but those you can get from another school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Illusion allows you to make up for the lack of choosing Evocation and Conjuration spells via the Shadow spells, though they are only quasi-real. You can still use it to create Contingency effects and the like, making Shadow Evocation a worthwhile investment. Illusion also offers such gems as Invisibility, Persistent Image, and the various disguise spells, without which you would have as much luck disguising yourself as a hydra with sunglasses trying to sneak in to a beholder only strip club.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;If you plan on becoming an Archmage with a school focus on Illusion, be prepared to write a doctoral thesis on the subject. Mine was on “Illusions and Invisibility”. For some reason the Arcane Comittee never found the manuscript, but I passed anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Divination is one of the better schools, as preparation is half the battle. However, some of its best spells are expensive to cast, so keep that in mind. I usually leave heavy divination to wizards.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Necromancy is considered the “dark” school, but I prefer to think of it as being “effective”. Now, I’m not saying you should burn the cities of your enemies, loot their towns, hear the lamentation of their women, pillage, rape, and rampage across the countryside while salting their fields and smashing their temples, but you don’t have to restrain yourself to playing the role of Mr. Nice Guy either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;A note: while it’s entirely possible and even commendable to have your undead hoards rescue orphans from a burning orphanage, there really are better ways of doing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Transmutation is in my opinion, tied with Conjuration for most the versatile school of magic. There is always something worthwhile to transmute, such as your enemies. For a more detailed argument as to why Transmutation is superior to most other schools, feel free to consult my doctoral thesis on the matter: &quot;Disintegration and Damnation.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Generally, I focused on a small amount of damage dealing spells, coupled with many defensive wards and offensive “buffs”. A key component of my style is the use of spells that require the target to either resist their effects (whether they be physical or mental) or be rendered useless. I believe it to be a more efficient way of dealing with problems than by simply blasting my way through, though I will concede that if you force the square peg hard enough, it will fit through the round hole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Now I hope you can ruminate while I loquaciously illuminate the core possibilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cantrips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Touch of Fatigue—While in the Junior Academy, Dalron sparred with Saal and cast this on Saal to make him tired. Saal responded by knocking Dalron lights out with an axe. I leave the lesson to be learned to you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Prestidigitation—It cooks, it cleans, it gets crumbs out of your Cloak of Charisma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Detect Magic—It detects magic. Yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Read Magic—It allows you to read magic. Yeah.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Detect Poison—Allows you to avoid spolt food and find booze.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Message—Pretending that you’re someone’s conscience never gets old.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ghost Sound—Provides a nice, ambient &quot;Bow chicka bow wow&quot; for your Luxurious Love Shack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Arcane Mark—In essence, magical graffiti. Leave it on the foreheads of your enemies and flings: &quot;A Wizard Did It&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Daze—It is a stunning spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Resistance—The only way to survive cafeteria food.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Light—And behold, there was light!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mending—This spell is all you need to impress the ladies. Keep their clothing trim and your's looking sharp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Tenser’s Floating Disk—Best used for practical jokes involving staircases. If Tenser was alive today, I’d use it on him for creating this sad excuse of a spell. I don't know what that man was smoking, but I want some of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mount—It’s a mount. You ride it to places. You can also sell it and run off with the money before the buyer realizes he’s been had. Unless you want to major in either swindling or liveries, pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Identify—You identify magic items for a price. If that’s your thing, go for it. If not, leave it to the nerds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sleep—The perfect antidote for when you can’t sleep due to being poked at with pointy sticks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Color Spray—Blind them with magic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Silent Image—Gives you more time to run from angry spouses by blanketing the house in illusory fog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Chill Touch—“I get to touch you and weaken you. You get to hit me with a huge hunk of metal.” Pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Expeditious Retreat—Run away! Run away!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;True Strike—Ah yes. Learn to use the Force.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Magic Missile—I keep it around for those pesky “class five roaming vapors” whom I can never quite Disintegrate properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shocking Grasp—My honorable enemy and worthy opponent, I concede to you the victory! Let us shake on it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Grease—Great for tripping up jocks, or enemies charging up a staircase at you—not that the two are mutually exclusive. Also, useful for lubrication.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shield, Mage Armor—No one will suspect that the man in a dress is abnormally hard to hit!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Charm Person—“Barkeep, you don’t need to see our identification.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Enlarge Person—Growth hormones!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ray of Enfeeblement—Jock-b-ware.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Tasha's Hideous Laughter—Why so serious? Let's put a smile on that face!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Resistance to Energy—Alas, poor Dalron’s second greatest foe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Alter Self—not only does this allow you to disguise yourself, but you can pretend to be of a different species. Gaining the scaly hide of a Troglodyte without its stench is never a bad thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Among its other uses is disguising yourself as an old lady and letting your purse be snatched by thieves while it contains a few notes worth of Explosive Runes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Bull’s Strength, Bear’s Endurance, Cat’s Grace—My voice gives me super strength!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Darkness—Provides concealment and DR10/Magic Missile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Blindness/Deafness—I do not see the see the appeal of this spell, nor have I heard of anyone getting good mileage out of it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shatter—Have you ever seen a jerk who bullied you as a kid buy an obscenely expensive ring to present to his bride at their wedding, only to have it shatter mysteriously at the altar? Fun times, fun times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Gust of Wind—It will blow you away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Magic Mouth—No, not that kind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Silence—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Invisibility—a great spell until Greater Invisibility is on the table, as it allows you to go to places you normally couldn’t go, such as the women’s shower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mirror Image—Greetings, Mr. Anderson. Today, you’ll be fighting me. Me, me, me, me, me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hypnotic Pattern—Bards? Who needs bards?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Minor Image—The cake is a lie!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Detect Thougths—Ah, your thoughts betray you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;See Invisibility—It helps detect peeping toms in showers, if nothing else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Glitterdust—Just because you can see invisible things doesn’t mean others can. Also blinds whatever gets hit by it. As some of us have found out the hard way, invisibly sneaking into a shower containing sorceresses who know both spells is not a good idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Web—Spider web, spider web, does whatever a spider's can. Spins a web, any size, catches thieves just like flies. Here comes the spider web.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Pyrotechnics—It makes things that are on fire dangerous to your enemies. However, in this cruel and unjust world of ours, enemies are often nor on or near fire consistently. Fortunately, Fireball can burninate from very far away. Also handy if you want to save a town by putting out a fire or fire elemental.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Acid Arrow—Handy, but I’ve never found a use for it, except when Extended in special circumstances. I will note though that you can use it to hit others from faaaaar off, which means you are less likely to be poked with a pointy stick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Scorching Ray—Dalron’s favorite spell when we were rooming together in the Junior Academy for Arcane Studies, and a powerful damage dealing spell, for the level, anyways. It is a great way to roast troll flesh, which doesn’t actually taste half bad with a little Prestidigitation thrown on for flavor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fly—Up, up, up and away!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Phantom Steed—Hail Shadowfax, king of horses, now with wings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Major Image—A most versatile and amusing spell as it contains auditory, olfactory, and thermal components. One student at the Arcane Institute had a tenancy to surprise intruders to his dorm by summoning an illusory fire around them. Since no one would actually dare to interact with the illusion to determine if it was real or not, it left them in the hot seat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Deeper Slumber—Arcane focus: your professor’s lecture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Heroism—My voice knows kung fu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hold Person—When one of the nobles at my local bar started giving gave me a hard time for getting all the ladies, I proceeded to stunned him, lift his robes over his head, and then walked away. No more was necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shrink Item—Shrinking large things and carrying them in your pocket does have uses. I remember that I was once fighting this witch whom I killed her by flying up in the air, invisible, and then dropping a shrunken house onto her, dismissing the spell as the house was en route to the ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Slow—Stopping things from reaching your is always a plus. It also works on undead, as it is not a mind-affecting spell. Best use, though, is at sporting competitions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Haste—Speedhack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Stinking Cloud—Not only does this cripple wizards and prevent them from casting spells, but has many applications in the realm of practical jokes. As a freshman at the Institute of Arcane Studies, there was a brief period where you could not trust the food at the dining hall because some anonymous student would find a way of slipping Beans of Stinking Cloud into the day’s meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Explosive Runes—Someone set us up the bomb! Makes for a great impromptu booby trap, way of paying a check with an unpleasant restaurant or shopkeeper, and ensuring that your letter self destructs after it is read.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Note: make sure that the recipient can survive an explosion before mailing the letter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dispel Magic—A lifesaver if you need to clear hallways of Stinking Clouds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Protection from Energy—Alas, poor Dalron’s greatest foe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fireball—Another of Dalron’s mainstays, this is a respectable spell for troubleshooting at long distances. Solving problems from far away is generally regarded as a good thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ray of Exhaustion—Jock-b-gone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Vampiric Touch—All your health is belong to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wind Wall—Take pride in rendering Elfy McElf, the Elvish archer utterly obsolete.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Enervation—Yes, it’s channeling the blackest of energies to cripple an opponent, making it an evil act. That being said, it is also a very effective spell. Learn it and let the Student Honor Council debate the ethics of using it. Empower for greater effect only if you can suppress the urge to spout out villainous laughter as you do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Greater Invisibility—Being unseen in the presence of a great and powerful monster is good. Nowadays, however, most of the opponents I face have ways to see through or negate Invisibility, so I usually spend it in attempts to avoid unwelcome relatives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Resilient Sphere—It protects and traps pretty much any one creature, even incorporeal or ethereal ones. No need to call ghost busters to trap your focused, non-terminal repeating phantasms anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Black Tentacles—In my younger days, I once managed to restrain a succubus with this spell. It proved effective, though not in the manner I was expecting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dimension Door—To quote the headmaster, “Great for getting you out of trouble—or into it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Solid Fog—The most solid of the fog spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Scrying—A great information gathering spell, but not something you will use all the time. Leave it to the book nerds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Phantasmal Killer—The only person scared to death was me after I learned it required two saves to take effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Charm Monster—Great for gathered information, incapacitating the enemy, making friends, and bending people to your will, though a bottle of dwarven fire whisky and a few glasses has about the same effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Confusion—Your enemy will hurt themselves in their confusion! It is super effective!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Polymorph—The most effective way of turning into a troll outside of joining 4chan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Feeblemind—Cast it on other magic users to humiliate them, or cast on your friendly meat shield to make him smarter. (I kid, Saal, I kid.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wall of Force—An absolutely fantastic spell. I have used it to trap monsters (with the powers of geometry), corner enemies in an Antimagic Field, and more. It may very well save your life, and help you end someone else’s. Remember, when casting a Wall of Force, NONE SHALL PASS!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wall of Stone: It rocks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Telekinesis—Can be used to manipulate things from far away, trip, disarm, pin down, or bull rush opponents (preferably into a Prismatic Sphere), and scratch those hard to reach places on your back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Persistent Image—Illusions are good and useful. Ever wanted to get out of dinner with your mother in law?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Here you go!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dominate Person—You will go home and rethink your life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hold Monster—Stupefy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cloudkill—If you ever face off against hoards of minions, by all means invite them to pull your finger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Lesser Planar Binding–More like Lesser Planar Bondage, if you know what I mean. You should have the charisma to take advantage of it, unlike those nerdy wizards. Give other people Nightmares!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Baleful Polymorph—Turn your enemies into newts. They won't get better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Contact Other Plane: Great spell… but are you going to use it every day? Of course not, you're not a nerd!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Disintegrate—As often said amongst the students of the Arcane Institute, “Handy for getting obstacles, objects, and people out of the way.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Flesh to Stone—Medusafying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dispel Magic, Greater—Useful for getting nasty effects out of the picture, like when you fail to resist a Dominate Person with your name on it and are forced to wait several months for your friends to rescue you from a Drow stronghold and return you to your right mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shadow Walk—The perfect way to send people to the Shadow Realm. Great way to transverse across time and space for cheap. Best used if you travel extensively and regularly, otherwise Limited Wish may be better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Bigby’s Forceful Hand—Talk to the hand!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;True Seeing—You see all, but at quite a&amp;nbsp; price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Eyebite—Behold the Evil Eye of Poogly Pie. Whomever sees it shall surely die. I’m glad you didn’t – you did? Goodbye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Greater Heroism—Are you a bad enough dude to be the hero?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Spell Turning—It helps you avoid getting killed by a Finger of Death to the face, if your friendly neighborhood cleric has neglected to cast Death Ward on you. A common sport my freshman year in the Arcane Institute was for two aspiring Archmages to turn up their Spell Turnings, cast Magic Missile at each other, and create a resonance effect. First to get back from the Astral Plane got a keg of beer. Loser had to foot the bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Arcane Sight, Greater—It is generally regarded as a good thing to know if the person you will be casting spells on today has Spell Turning on or not. Also, useful for qualification for Archmage, as those old geezers on the Archmage’s Council will want to see ‘diversity’ among the schools of magic in your spell list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ethereal Jaunt—In another dimension, with voyeuristic intention, well secluded, I see all!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Limited Wish—For a small price, you can make up for one important spell you do not know. Priceless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mass Hold Person—Stop in the name of love, baby!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Insanity—This is MADNESS!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Bigby’s Grasping Hand—provides cover, rushes, and gropes at your command.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Forcecage—One of the greatest joys in life is to cast Forcecage on a dual lance wielding mounted charger, rendering his entire training up to this point moot. Expensive to cast, though. You’d probably be better off casting Fly on yourself and taunting him from above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Prismatic Spray—Color your enemy surprised with one of 8 dazzling outcomes!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Delayed Blast Fireball—Burn everything. Burn it to the ground. There is nothing quite like seeing five of these go off at one time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Simulacrum—Materials for cloning: 2000 gp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;XP cost for cloning: 2000 XP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Having a threesome consisting of only you and your spouse?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Priceless&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Finger of Death—Avada Kerdava! Bonus points if you guess which finger it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Maze—Best way to amaze a Feebleminded enemy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Reverse Gravity—If your enemy does not yet know how to fly, they soon will.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Greater Prying Eyes—Free scouts with True Seeing are always useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Greater Shadow Evocation—Like Shades, it allows you to make up for your limited spells known. Try using it to mimic Leomund’s Tiny Hut while traveling or Contingency if you’re paranoid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Greater Planar Binding-Glabrezu, I choose you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Prismatic Wall—Taste the rainbow, bitch!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Bigby’s Clenched Fist—Your reach will no longer exceed your grasp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mind Blank—It saves you from the humiliation of failing to resist a Dominate Person and becoming the personal slave to some Drow matron. Some people had to learn this lesson the hard way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Horrid Wilting—My favorite mass removal/gardening spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Otto’s Irresistible Dance—Stop! Its hammer time!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Polymorph Any Object—You can now polymorph things into cheese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Level 9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dominate Monster—While some may have an issue mind controlling other sentient beings, I submit that if they are doing some thing truly wicked, a brief spell as my personal servant followed by a Helm of Opposed Alignments should solve the problem. A redeemed person is, after all, more useful to society than a dead one. That being said, this does not work on many creatures (read: undead), nor ones with the proper warding (Protection from X, Mind Blank), so perhaps it is not the best choice for this category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Prismatic Sphere—This spell is simply fabulous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shades—These sort of illusion spells effectively allow you to know several lower level spells for the price of one, as well as offering you endless amounts of fun with such great spells as Leomund’s Luxurious Love Shack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Time Stop—With a bit of a mind flip, you're there in the time slip, and nothing can ever be the same, for you're spaced out on sensation, like you're under sedation. But listen closely (not for very much longer), I've got to keep control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Somatic components: It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the right. With your hands on your hips you bring your knees in tight. But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane; let's do the Time Stop again!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Astral Projection—Send in the clones! Pricy, but it lets you duplicate of yourself, gear included, and then travel back to the Material Plane (or Plane Shifting back). Caution: Never leave your comatose body in the possession of a Succubus, even if you did use a Helm of Opposed Alignments on her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Meteor Swarm—Finish him!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wail of the Banshee—Dalron singing in the shower will suffice nicely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Weird—Mind Crush! (Not really... giving your opponent two chances to save is bad.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wish—Say what you wish, whatever it be, it's yours true dish, just pay up some XP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Gate—Great spell for interplanar travel. Superb spell for running away from your mother in law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Power Word Kill—Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja!... Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shapechange—You are everything, ever. Warning: Not for the lactose intolerant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Foresight—My Spidey-senses are tingling!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Disjunction—A magical EMP (Exterminatus Magic Pulse) that fries everything, including your potential loot. Only use if you don't plan on salvaging from the broken bodies of your enemies. Perhaps as a scroll...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;On Metamagic Majors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;By Shneeky the Lost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Very interesting and useful treatise, I must say. However, if I may make some... shall we say 'counterpoints'?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I think you are vastly underestimating the value of certain metamagic majors. You see, The strength of the Sorcerer, to use a witty phrase a good Fighter friend of mine used, is Tactical rather than Strategic. When asked to expound upon this, he explained that Strategy is planning ahead, whereas Tactics is dealing with the immediate situation with what you have. I found it a remarkable counterpoint of Sorcerers and Wizards for a person who has absolutely no knowledge of magical prowess. And so, my humble opinion on the various options for metamagic majors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Empower Spell: I find this to be a false economy the majority of the time. Two spell levels later, you can generally find something far more damaging. There are certain exceptions, such as when the damage is of a particularly rare type, or the damage affects the person's well-being in ways more than mere physical damage. Examples of this would be Magic Missile, which deals Force damage, and never miss, so the guaranteed damage may be worth the 3rd level spell normally reserved for something like a Fireball; and Enervation, which does negative levels, making it an exceptionally nasty spell indeed. Other than these rare exceptions, however, I find it not nearly as valuable as some of the others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Enlarge Spell: While keeping foes with sharp pointy things well away from you is always a good thing, this isn't as effective at doing it as one might think. Consider a moment that it does not work on spells you have to touch to cast, and that even the newest Sorcerer on the block can cast Close range spells up to thirty feet away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Extend Spell: I find this to be sub-par in my experience. You see, once you gain a moderate amount of magical prowess, your spells with a duration of hours/level will practically last all adventuring day, using either the humble Rope Trick or the upgraded Mordikain's Magnificent Love Shack to keep yourself safe once the spells have expired. During combat, the duration is almost pointless, as combat will almost certainly be over before you spell is. In your younger days, when you need it the most, you are least able to afford the price tag associated with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Heighten Spell: A deceptively useful one, and often overlooked. Why, then, would I wish to cast a low level spell in a higher level spell slot? Why, because you are no wizard who has to guess in advance which spells he needs to memorize for the day and what metamagic to apply at that time, your tactical versatility is such that even your humble low level spells can affect a surprisingly potent foe when dropped into a higher level spell slot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Remember, you are a Sorcerer, you have few high level spells known, but many times a day to cast it. This means that you will often have high-end spell slots available. So when your opponent thinks he can easily overcome the Stinking Cloud, only to be overcome by the fumes when cast as a 9th level spell. In this case, it increases the DC of the spell by 6, which is the equivalent of a +12 to Charisma (impossible through pre-epic means), or an Archmage devoted exclusively to increasing his spell power AND has an Ioun Stone which increases it still further.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;This makes your low-end spells still viable and useful even very late in your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Maximize Spell: A false economy, I fear. While many 'blasters' drool over this one, it's actually not as useful as it may appear to be. It is cast as a spell three levels higher. So let us once again use that staple, the Fireball. A Maximized Fireball deals a guaranteed 60 damage (10d6) as a 6th level spell. Let us browse the list of 6th level spells, shall we? We have Disintegrate, but that's not really a fair comparison, now is it? Ahh, here we go, Evocation has two different 'blasters' at 6th: Chain Lightning and Freezing Sphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Now then, of the two, Freezing Sphere is the most similar, so let us use it by way of comparison. This particularly little nuke deals 15d6 (15d8 vs water elementals and the like, but those are so rare, let's just ignore that, shall we). Now then, the law of averages and bell curves indicates that this spell will average out to somewhere between 45 and 60 damage. So, not a whole lot of difference in damage output, but Freezing Sphere also lets you freeze water, making it possible to create walkways across otherwise impassible water sources, trap monsters who are currently in the water, and in general has a lot more utility use than Fireball does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Right, let's look at Chain Lightning briefly, shall we? First off, it's damage is capped at 20d6, which means it will, on average, actually do MORE damage than the Maximized Fireball toward the end of your career, PLUS it arcs to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level, each one doing half damage. That's a lot better than the Maximized Fireball to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Quicken Spell: Core, unable to be used by us. Pity, and the nerds wizards never let us forget it, either. If you allow PhB II rules, possibilities open up, and it becomes an extremely valuable tool.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Silent Spell: Always handy to have, since we don't have to guess which spells we'll need to cast silently, unlike some people. Very useful for when captured and gagged, or when in a Zone of Silence, or similar effect. Everyone knows that silencing is the best method of shutting down a caster. Learn this and prove them wrong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Still Spell: Also an extremely useful metamagic, and one I'm surprised wasn't mentioned earlier. This spell lets you cast spells without somatic components. This means, among other things, that Arcane Spell Failure does not apply to that particular spell, meaning you can be disguised as a 'tank' in full plate with a tower shield, and can still flawlessly perform arcane feats of prowess. It also means you can cast while grappled, making it invaluable in those sticky situations. It also means you can be clapped in irons in a dungeon and can still cast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;In fact, I'm reminded of one time when we were ambushed at night and taken captive. I was thrown in prison, chained to the wall, and gagged. My tormentor came to my prison and began taunting me about how useless I was now that I couldn't cast, waving the dummy spellbook I always keep on my person, which is always a worthwhile deception in such situations. My response of a Stilled and Silent Shatter on my bonds, followed up by a Phantasmal Killer on my strong but dumb tormentor. By the time the guards arrived after hearing his screams, I was already ready with a Prismatic Wall across the entrance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Widen Spell: Deceptively Dangerous. As my smart Fighter friend used to say: Friendly Fire Isn't. Being hung my my toes from a rather large tree, I had ample time to consider the profound statement, and came to realize that he was a bit miffed about being caught in the effect of the Stinking Cloud I had cast at the opponent casters to keep them from casting. You see, a lot of the things you're casting works do not come equipped with a method of identifying friend from foe. Expanding the radius of the effect only compounds the problem further. And before one points out the example of the Archmage's Mastery of Shaping to negate this problem, may I point out that your associates would likely want to move around, rather than be stuck in the same small area that was exempted for their benefit? Also, depending on the duration of the spell, they may be stuck there for some time unless you are willing to spend another spell to dispel your effect. Undamaged, to be sure, but also rather upset with you for keeping them stuck in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sculpt Spell allows you shape your spell into several useful shapes, as detailed on a list, for a +1 level adjustment. Totally worth it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Smiting Spell, another +1 metamagic feat, allows you to store a spell in a weapon, releasing it when it hits an enemy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Solonotes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Invisible spell is a +0 LA metamagic feat from Cityscape. It makes your spells... invisible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fell Drain Spell: for a +2 level adjustment, your spell inflicts one negative level if it damages a target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sanctum Spell: Raises the effective spell level by one if used inside the sanctum. Lowers it by one if used outside the sanctum. ironically, best when used out of your sanctum combined with metamagic (ab)use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;On the Importance of Planning Properly for Tactical Advantage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;A useful reference for Sorcerers on the choosing of known spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;By: Pip Tallowberry – Sorcerer, Abjurant Champion, and Archmage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Good day ta ye, an' well met. In this particular section, we will be discussing a significant portion of a Sorcerer's power, properly choosing a spell list which will meet your needs. Many sorcerers have difficulties in choosing a properly balanced spell list, which often results in gaping holes in their defenses, or blind spots in their offensive repertoire. The sad fact is that no sorcerer ever knows enough spells to satisfy him or her. However, with proper care and planning, one can find a suitably flexible spell list which can accommodate nearly any situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Let us go over the criteria for properly choosing spells:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* Each spell must be able to be applied in different situations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* Each spell must be something you can reasonably expect to cast on a near daily basis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* Each spell must be not only powerful when you learn it, but must also continue to be useful well into your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;As a Sorcerer, you actually possess more magical might than even a Wizard, however you lack the flexibility of a Wizard's grimoire to switch out spells on a daily basis. This means your spell list must be able to be applied to literally every situation you find yourself in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Due to the limited number of spells you can learn, you must choose those spells you can expect to cast multiple times, building on your strengths as a Sorcerer to cast more times a day than a wizard of equal learning. As such, you are able to toss a spell when a wizard might think twice, but you must make sure that it is a spell you want to have tossed in that situation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Also, it is difficult to switch out spells, so each spell must be good not only when you find it, but must remain useful for the long haul, as only a limited number of times can you switch out your spells known list.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Also, may I respectfully submit that doing damage is less effective than inflicting status effects? Let's face it, a Fighter with a big sword and the skill to use it is going to be doing more damage than most of our 'nukes' anyways. Let him have his share of the limelight, and cripple opponents so he can mow them down easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;With this in mind, let us look at the spell list with these criteria in mind:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;1st level spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Now then, your advantage early in your career is that you can cast your spells multiple times, but you only get two that you know. With this in mind, you need at least one defensive spell, and one offensive spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For defensive spells, Magic Armor and Shield are the two most prominent. Mage Armor has a duration of hours/level whereas Shield only has a duration of rounds/level. This can be a problem early on, as the Shield only lasts a short time, perhaps not enough time to finish a battle, whereas Mage Armor will at least last the fight. Later on, you will find you can cast a Mage Armor early in the day, and have it last all day long, not needing to cast it in combat, making it very convenient. However, Shield is one of the very few methods to foil a Magic Missile spell, which can kill a fragile sorcerer in one hit at lower levels, or severely wound even at higher levels, and never misses. I would suggest choosing one of these two spells, but probably not both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For Offensive punch, you have a wide number of options, depending on how you feel like doing things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;For straight blasting, the old reliable Magic Missile is always a decent choice. It always hits, it always does damage, it always affects the target. It might not be one to pick up immediately, due to it's low damage output compared to a crossbow, but it is a staple for a reason. Certainly pick this up soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Burning Hands is your first chance to do damage to multiple opponents, but it's not as good as it may seem. You see, you are typically not going to be on the front line. That means your friends are likely to be in the area along with your foes. That's a very bad thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shocking Grasp is somewhat better, but requires you to touch your opponent. Particularly early in your career, the very last thing you want to do is get within melee range with something that has a weapon. It is, however, fun at parties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Chill Touch, the necromancer's first step, has the same problem as Shocking Grasp. The last thing you want to do is get close enough to touch someone hostile, because they will be swinging something big and dangerous at you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;If you prefer something other than damage to disable your opponents, you've got some good options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sleep. At the very beginning of your career, absolutely one of the most powerful spells in your potential repertoire. Later in your career, absolutely worthless. The early power of this spell is such that you may well consider taking it to start with, using an opportunity later in your career to switch it out with something more useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Grease. Very useful throughout your entire career. Many things are not particularly agile, and this is one of the spells which ignores spell resistance. I've used the humble Grease spell to disable even a mighty Balor before. Do not underestimate it's power. It is also extremely versatile, useful in a wide number of situations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Color Spray. Not as powerful as Sleep, nor as easy to aim, but useful for far longer in your career.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ray of Enfeeblement. Starts off fairly good, but it's power starts to wane, as it only applies a penalty, not actual stat damage. Still, even later in your career, handy to pair with Ray of Exhaustion to cripple the combat potential of a particularly strong foe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Once you are able to widen your knowledge of the first level of spells, there are some very handy utility spells you may want to pick up as well&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;True Strike. When that ray absolutely, positively has to hit it's target. It practically guarantees a hit. Very handy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Feather Fall. Because the best way of avoiding attacks is to be above them out of reach. And because opponent casters sometimes know Dispel Magic. Remember, this can be cast on others, like the Rogue who just triggered the pit trap.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Comprehend Languages. Because it's always nice to know if they're discussing letting you go or how you would taste in the stew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Enlarge Person. Surprisingly useful. Cast on your 'meat shield', and watch him stomp the bad guys flat. It also makes him draw fire, leaving you unmolested to continue casting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Alarm. Because being asked to sit second watch sucks. In general, however, not really worth it to learn. Rope Trick is much better, and is just next level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Summon Monster I. Extremely useful. Everything from trap-tripping at a safe distance to creating flanking opportunities for your rogue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;2nd level spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;At this level are a wide number of options, depending on what you want to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Defensive Spells you may want:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;If you are being plagued by a certain flavor of elemental damage, Resist Energy is very handy. Otherwise, not worth blowing a spell known on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Protection from Arrow. If you don't let them close, they're going to try shooting at you. Still, only situationally useful if you don't run across many archers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mirror Image. Get this first. This spell is your most useful defensive spell in your entire career. Let's look at numbers, shall we? Displacement, which you don't get until next spell level, gives you at 50% chance of not being hit. This spell summons 1d4+1/3 levels images that they might hit. This means, if you are unlucky, you have two other images, so you only have a 33% chance of being hit. If you roll well, the odds of you being hit after being targeted go down to 12.5%, making it in every way superior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Invisibility. Extraordinarily useful for many different situations. The party rogue will also beg you for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And now for some offensive punch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The two staple ray damage spells are here at this level: Melf's Acid Arrow and Scorching Ray. The Acid Arrow only does 2d6, although persisting damage for a round or two. The Scorching Ray, on the other hand, does 4d6, and later on can have up to three rays for a total of 12d6 if all three hit. Acid Arrow does acid damage, which is rare to encounter resistance against AND ignores spell resistance. Scorching Ray does all of it's damage up front, and generally has more damage output, but is subject to spell resistance and fire is the most often protected against flavor to throw. If you insist, choose one OR the other, you don't have enough spells known to grab both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Glitterdust is both offensive and utility. Not only does it blind foes, but it also reveals invisible things. Extremely handy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Web. A very valuable 'crowd control' spell which also does not allow spell resistance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hideous Laughter. It's always dangerous to get too close, but if they fail their save, they're not going to be hurting you anyways. This is good for shutting down pesky rogues with high reflex saves or big dumb fighter types.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Touch of Idiocy. Your first actual stat damage spell, and one specifically targeting other casters. Too bad you have to touch them for it to affect them, but dropping their primary casting stat 1d6 is always a worthwhile thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shatter. Ahh, the many wondrous and splendor'd things one may do with this spell. Even does damage to crystalline beings and golems, and one of the very few spells which does.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Blindness/Deafness. It is very difficult to hit what you cannot see. The Fort save makes it ideal for hitting opponent casters or pesky rogues with. Not so much for the charging barbarians, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Scare. Often overlooked. While not very valuable later on, for the same reason Sleep is nearly worthless later on, Fear effects are crippling for opponents, and no friendly fire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And there is some very useful Utility spells you may be interested in picking up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rope Trick. This is one of my favorite early spells, getting this after I get Mirror Image. While I don't contribute much offensive punch, I guarantee we won't be jumped in our sleep, allowing us to sleep soundly. Only problem is you can't bring an animal companion or beast of burden up the rope easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;See Invisible. So you know if you need to Glitterdust something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Alter Self. While I've never used it, by virtue of my allergy to cheese, it's easily the most overpowered spell of this level. +8 to natural armor, and all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;{Animal}'s {stat}. In general, not useful for you to learn, however the Con bonus is always a useful thing for everyone. More hit points is good. Note: The +Cha spell does *NOT* increase the DC of your spells, don't bother with it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Levitate. Your first opportunity to rise above your foes. Not too useful, though. Wait until next level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Knock. Extremely situational, and isn't that why you brought a Rogue along with the party? Wand it if you feel so inclined, but never learn it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;3rd Level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ahh, many staples are to be found here, you start to really hit your stride with some potent choices. Choosing the right ones out of this level is always difficult, because there are so many good choices. Whatever you do, make sure that you keep all your bases covered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Defensive Capability&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Protection from Energy. It isn't the best choice, unless you're really seeing a lot of energy damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Magic Circle of Protection from Alignment. Let the Cleric or the Wizard pick this up, you've got too many other choices in front of you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Nondetection. Every time you cast it, it's 50 gold. It adds up. If you cast it enough for it to be worth it to know, you're going to have to insist on compensation for all the money going down the drain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wind Wall. Protection from Arrows' bigger brother. Complete immunity to projectiles. Handy when paired with flying. Also difficult to get the combo off and still contribute meaningfully to the party.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Displacement. We already covered this, Mirror Image is superior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Invisibility Sphere. Good for cloaking the party, assuming everyone gets real friendly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Gaseous Form. Handy, but also really cramps your casting ability. Probably not worth it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Offensive Punch. Got a lot of options here, and some good old classics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fireball and Lightning bolt are both here. Pick one or the other up, not both. You have too many other things to get this level to remain balanced, getting both will cripple you. However, these are staples because they are effective against crowds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Explosive Runes. Almost utility, but it's probably Abjuration's only spell that actually does damage, so I'll go ahead and list it as offensive. Best of all, anyone reading it doesn't get a save, so it'll even bag rogues. It's a lot of fun, but hard to fit into a sorcerer's limited number of spells known.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sleet Storm. It ignores SR, which makes it handy, and it forces balance checks, making it Grease's bigger brother, and it blocks line of sight, keeping you from being hit by obnoxious attacks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Stinking Cloud. Oh my, the fun I've had with this one. It requires a Fort save. Against barbarians, not the best choice of weapon. Against rogues and casters, however, priceless. A distinct lack of allowing SR means it remains useful even late into your career. One of the better battlefield control spells, and one I suggest you find a way of duplicating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hold Person. Nah, let the Cleric do this, he gets it a level earlier anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Deep Slumber. While Sleep attacks are vicious, the limit on HD is crippling at this point in your career. Sadly, probably not worth it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ray of Exhaustion. How to stop a charging barbarian, other than by taking his credit card. Even if he makes his save, he's still fatigued. Either way, he's taking penalties to Strength and Dex. As nice as that is, there's probably better things to learn. But if you want to be a ray specialist, this is one to pick up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Haste. It's a buff, but a very nasty one. Your entire party gets a lot of benefits that they will all enjoy. This will almost always out-damage any straight damage spells at this level by virtue of the additional damage the rest of the party is cranking out thanks to the extra attacks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Slow. A crippling spell to cast on any big dumb thing charging at you. They get to choose between either a move action OR a standard action. That means they can't take a full attack, which helps your party's health and well being. Highly useful, and *NOT* mind-affecting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Magic Weapon, Greater. It's use ramps up as you go up in level. Casting this on a daily basis on your tank's primary weapon means he gets to spend more money on other things. It will also typically out-damage any nuke you would cast, due to the extra damage on every hit he lands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Several utility options here as well:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Phantom Steed. Hours/level duration. By 14th level, it's effectively Overland Flight, as a 3rd level spell. Better than Fly later on, but Fly gets you airborne earlier. Take your pick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fly. You can't hit what you can't reach. Much more useful than Levitate. Upgrade to Overland Flight. However, see Phantom Steed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dispel Magic. Get this. If nothing else, it can be used to counterspell. It can also be used to remove debuffs on your allies, or buffs on enemies. Upgrade to Greater Dispel Magic when you get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Arcane Sight. Always handy to know if there's something magical in the area, or if the opponents are buffed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Tongues. Like Comprehend Languages, only better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Tiny Hut. Rope Trick is better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;4th level spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Some very tasty choices here. Be careful you don't get seduced into unbalancing yourself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Defensive Spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Stoneskin. Very expensive to cast repeatedly. Not worth it for personal use (see also: Mirror Image). If your party asks you to learn it, ask for compensation. 250 a pop adds up quick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Invisibility, Greater. The Rogue will bow at your feet is you drop it on him at the beginning of a fight. Ironically, not very useful for personal use, due to Mirror Image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Remove Curse. Let the Cleric get this one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser. Immunity to 1st through 3rd level spells. Not too shabby. Unfortunately, unless you're planning on a steady stream of mage duels with lower level casters, probably not going to be cast enough to be worth learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Offensive Punch. Got some tasty choices here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Black Tentacles. Shuts down casters, since you can't cast while grappled. Also severely screws over rogues, who generally aren't too good in a grapple either. Plus makes you very popular at anime conventions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Solid Fog. No save, No SR, you just suck it up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Confusion. Confusion to the Enemies! Seriously, this is an encounter-winner against anything without a very good will save.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Resilient Sphere. Offensive, defensive, utility... very handy little spell. Protect fallen comrades, protect yourself if you get attacked, bubble the opponent casters to drop them out of the fight, bubble the charging barbarian. Possibilities are endless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Phantasmal Killer. Your first death effect. Sadly, allows two different saving throws, either one of which will save his bacon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Bestow Curse. Let the Cleric do this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Enervation. Now we're talking! Negative levels are very nasty. This is one of the few spells that is worthwhile to metagmagic for greater effect (Empower). This is a staple in any serious mage's repertoire. Learn it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fear. Like Confusion, Fear is absolutely an encounter winner. Be careful to not hit your own allies in the cone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;And for the Utility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dimension Door. Get This. Seriously, one of the best 'get out of YES' cards available. It requires no somatic components, so you can even cast it while grappled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dimensional Anchor. A very useful spell, handy for keeping opponent mages from poofing away. Unless you're encountering a large number of things that like to teleport/ethereal, probably not worthwhile learning. Do keep a few scrolls handy, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shadow Conjuration. With your limited spell list, you'd figure this is a spell to get right off the bat, right? Well, maybe not. Here's the problem. Will save or only 20% effective. Granted, this duplicates a lot of nifty effects, but generally it isn't worth it to get this particular shadow spell, but do look up the higher level one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Polymorph. I can't even go near this spell without breaking out into hives. This isn't Gouda, this is Limburger... really stinky cheese.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;5th level spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Got some staple classics in here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Defensive Spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;There's really no defensive spells at this level. It's all offensive and utility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Offensive Spells:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dismissal. Two problems with this. 1) Outsiders have a high Will save, 2) Outsiders generally have SR. Not a very effective method of dealing with outsiders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cloudkill. Fort save or Con damage, but even if you make it, you still take Con damage. Kills mooks dead. Also handy for fumigating your place. It doesn't even allow for SR.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Feeblemind. Tailor made to punk other arcane casters. Drops the casting stat to 1, means no casting at all. Congratulations, you're a gimped commoner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mind Fog. It would have been pretty sweet... if it didn't allow a Will save. It would have been the ultimate combo, Mind Fog/Feeblemind. As it is, almost pointless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hold Monster. Let the Cleric handle this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cone of Cold. It's a blaster spell. If you like that sort of thing, go for it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shadow Evocation. Most of them now have two different saves, Will and Reflex, but if you want to blast, this would probably be more versatile than getting a bunch of different evocations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Baleful Polymorph. Probably the only spell in the Polymorph sub-college that I can stand to get near. Pretty obnoxious, although there's a few things out there immune to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Telekenisis. Toss your enemies around. Toss your enemies off cliffs, back into the Cloudkill, into a Prismatic Wall/Sphere...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Utility Spells&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Break Enchantment. Let the Cleric handle this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Teleport. If you get this, you will be the party's port bi... erm, I mean Taxi Cab. However, there's few enough spells at this level which are really worth it for Sorcerers to pick up that you may want to get it. At least then your party will never lack for swift transportation to known locations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Prying Eyes. Not as useful as the greater version, but not a bad method of knowing what lies ahead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wall of Force. Probably the only Wall worth getting (other than Prismatic). It requires magic to get rid of, so it can be a major stumbling block if placed properly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Passwall. Doors? We don't need no stinkin' doors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The Prestige – A Compilation of Sorcerous Academies and Specialties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;A reference guide to finding alternate paths to sorcerous might&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;By: Pip Tallowberry – Sorcerer, Abjurant Champion, and Archmage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Now then, it has been requested that someone compile and list the various alternate methods of gaining sorcerous knowledge and power. Seeing as how I have many of the reference books available to me, I have decided to take it upon myself to assay this difficult task.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Before we begin, I would like to point out that I shall only cover the material in the reference books which I have, which is to say PHBII and most of the Completes (Complete Mage, Arcane, Warrior, Divine, Adventurer; Tome of Battle; Heroes of Battle and Heroes of Horror).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Also, let us look carefully at what criteria a Sorcerer should probably use when choosing their specialty:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* It must have a very good spell progression. - What is the point in going through all the trouble to learn additional knowledge when you shirk on your primary arcane might? You are even more hampered here than the Wizard, who gets his 9th level spells first. Except in very rare occasions, any Sorcerer worth the title should plan on trying to get access to 9th level spells at or before level 20. This means you only have 2 levels you can afford to let slip.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* Watch entrance requirements - There's a lot of specialty schools which make their entrance requirements much easier for a Wizard than a mage. For example, the Loremaster requires knowledge of a LOT of different Divination spells. Easy for a Wizard to include in his spellbook, but crippling for a Sorcerer. Also pay particular attention to Feat requirements, as you only get a few of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* It must improve your ability to perform your chosen calling - There are a lot of places which teach things that are... less useful for a Sorcerer. The ability to scribe more spells into your spellbook, for instance, is not particularly useful for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;With these in mind, let us begin with some of the more useful and popular choices:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;From Complete Arcane:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Acolyte of the Skin - Half caster progression. For this reason alone, move along. The class abilities are generally not too powerful. Typical, demons promise much, then you find out just how little they really promised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Alienist - Very creepy, but hey, if that's your thing, it's actually not too bad a choice. Full spellcasting progression, fairly easy entrance requirements. Sure, you lose your sanity in the process, but applying Pseudonatural template to everything you summon for free isn't too bad. Get some bonus Metamagic, which is our bread and butter. Upon graduating, you get DR 10/magic, gain the Outsider type, and some Acid Resistance. If you're interested, apply to Miskatonic U. For some reason, they always seem to be taking new students.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Argent Savant - Normally, specialist courses like this spell trouble for Sorcerers, who lack the depth of repertoire to make up the lack elsewhere, but this one actually isn't too bad. You do lose one level of spellcasting, and it's the first level, which does kind of suck. But the truly sucky part of this is trying to qualify with knowing 5 different Force spells. May I direct you to Shield, Mage Armor, and Magic Missiles, all of which are 1st level spells? Force damage is nice, and this will significantly contribute to the damage of your Magic Missiles. Furthermore, it will also increase the defensive value of both Shield and Mage Armor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Blood Magus - Okay, you lose 2 caster levels, which is painful, but at least you can still get a 9th level spell if you're careful. It requires a couple of worthless feats, which hurts more. The abilities are actually kind of on the weak side, really. Blood Component, hurt yourself to get the Eschew Materials feat. Not too useful. Durable Casting - if you're only getting hit for 5-10 damage a shot, you won't need to worry about making Concentration checks anyways. Staunch - By the time you get this, the odds of landing right in that -1 to -10 area is pretty slim. Things tend to either leave you a greasy stain or miss. Scarification/Blood drought really aren't your cup of tea, you don't know enough spells to make them worth it. Bloodwalk is about the only thing really worth it, but it's still only so-so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Effigy Master - Not worth it for a Sorcerer. Too many skills required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Elemental Savant - Oh yea, this one is real popular with the Blasters. Sad thing is, it cripples you. So now you're a blaster, already not as powerful as some of the choices, but you only blast in one element. Ummm... pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fatespinner - Now we're talking. Don't feel bad if you have to drop out before you graduate, everyone else does too. That last level really isn't worth the loss of caster level, but the rest are very useful indeed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Geometer - It's for Wizards more than us. Too many extra hoops for us to jump through, and the primary benefits are pointless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Green Star Adept - Turning into a golem, with all the immunities implied, sounds like a good deal, right? But not at the cost of only half casting progression. Before you point out all the immunities again, may I point out the immunity to cure spells? Better hope you can pick up some Repair Damage spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil - The entrance requirements are very steep, and again Wizards have an easier time qualifying than we do, but it is very much worth it. If you haven't picked up three abujration spells before you hit 8th level, then I am surprised. Shield and Dispel Magic are both 'must have' spells. Pick one random aburation spell, then two of 4th or higher. That probably means you're not entering until 10th level or later. But that's okay, it's only 7 levels anyways, and most of the prerequisite feats also help you apply for Archmage. And oh the cheese...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mage of the Arcane Order - Yet another case where the entrance requirements favor Wizards over Sorcerers, but this one is so much more worth it for us that it's worth blowing the extra feat to qualify. Pulling any spell out of your hat when you need it is just too handy for the flexibility-impaired Sorcerer. And hey, it's not like you're going to have to worry about Spellpool debt, with as many spells per day as you cast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Master Transmogrifiest - Friends don't let friends do cheese. This is a specialty which focuses on making cheese even cheesier. But does so poorly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mindbender - If it wasn't half casting progression, it wouldn't be bad. As it is, don't take more than one level for telepathy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wayfarer Guide - Pointless. Grab Teleport, Greater instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wild Mage - Friends don't let friends do Wild Magic. Seriously, this stuff is as likely to hurt you as to help you. Avoid this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;From Complete Adventurer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Only one arcane class here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Daggerspell Mage - Requires at least a one-level dip on another class, and the 1st level doesn't promote casting. This is designed more for the rogue/sorcerers who are more into knifing than tricking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;From Complete Divine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Yea, divine. I guess some Sorcerers 'get religion'. It's generally a bad idea, though, as far as Arcane Might goes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rainbow Servant - On first blush, it looks pretty awesome, gain knowledge of all cleric spells! But wait... you just get access to them. You still have to buy them with spells known slots. In other words, it's like Mystic Theurge, with more Suck and fewer spells per day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;From Complete Mage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;There's some gems here, diamonds in the (very) rough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Abjurant Champion - At first glance, you might say 'Gish Class, move on', but wait, why is it only for Gish? Okay, it requires a BAB +5, that means you can't enter until after 10th level. So what, it's only a five level PrC anyways. The proficiency in one martial weapon might hurt, although Elves get lucky here. In exchange, you get full casting, full BAB progression, and look at the abilities! First off, your Shield spell gets it's defensive bonus beefed up. How about a +9 to AC from it? Then, at 2nd level, you get to auto-quicken it! Considering how difficult it is for us to be able to quicken ANYTHING, this is GOLD. You can also beef up AC or saves or elemental resistance on the fly if something is about to do something nasty to you. The D10 Hit Die doesn't hurt either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Holy Scourge - Hey, you can blast for a little more damage against specific things! In exchange, you lose a caster level and you get the Paladin stick-up-your-Pigu class ability! Ummm... pass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Nightmare Spinner - Oh, now here is some potential. You lose a spell level, but not bad class abilities. One extra spell cast per level per day, but it has to be Illusion. Oh boo hoo, I get to be able to cast Mirror Image more times per day. Immunity to Fear, because Fear sucks. Inspire Fear, again, because Fear sucks. Later on, this gets situational as you run into more things immune to mind-affecting, but hey, this isn't bad for shutting things down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Unseen Seer - Like Arcane Trickster, but with a different flavor. Don't bother, it does increase your CL for Divination, but dumps the rest by an equal amount. Plus, it requires a crapton of skills, requiring multiple levels of Rogue to qualify. Good for a rogue/sorcerer build, but not for a straight Sorcerer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Complete Warrior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Only two in here are Rage Mage, and Spellsword. Both are for Gishes, which we won't go into here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sandstorm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;One PrC from Sandstorm merits mention, the Sand Shaper. It's has some interesting and useful abilities, and only costs 2 caster levels in the long run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Taking a single level in this class gives the Desert Insight class feature, which adds a ton of spells to your spells known, covering a variety of uses, including utility, blasting, summoning, and save-or-die spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Solonotes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fiend Blooded (HoH): 9/10 casting, but the lost level is the final one. Boosts stats, gives extra spells, and some nice abilities. It requires two so so feats and Knowledge (the planes) 8 ranks. Sorcerers don't have Knowledge (the Planes) as a class skill, but all their example characters are Sorcerer 6/Fiend-Blood X for some reason. Ask your DM to make an adjustment, or take Knowledge Devotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ruathar (RotW): Easy to qualify for by level 6 (earlier if using tricks). Gives all knowledge skills and 4 skill points/level for three levels. Speak, elf-friend, and enter into this handy prestige class!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;War Weaver (HoB): 4/5 casting. Buffing is good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dracolexi (RotD): 9/10 casting, but decent abilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Incantatrix (PGtF): Metamagic on crack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Escalation Mage (FoE): A decent prestige class that lets you mimic the effects of some handy metamagic feats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Esoteric Arcana – Additional Tips for the Non-Core Sorcerer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Non-core spells of note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sphere of Ultimate Destruction, level 9 (SpC): Disintegrate on steroids. You're basically summoning a black hole and throwing it at enemies. A singularity useful spell.&amp;nbsp; I hope you have been practicing your evil laughter. It's all about standards, folks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Maw of Chaos, level 9 (SpC): An AOE damage spell that deals 1d6/caster level force damage and disrupts concentration. Crazy good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Reaving Dispel, level 9 (SpC): All your buffs are belong to me!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Warning: use Greater Arcane Sight to make sure you don't slap a Dominate Person on yourself by accident.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Superior Invisibility, level 8 (SpC): Superior Invisibility is superior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Greater Arcane Fusion, level 8, and Arcane Fusion, level 5 (CM): Two lower level spells for the price of one higher level spell slot? Sign me up!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Arcane Spellsurge, level 7 (DM): It makes your spells spells take one less round to cast, turning full-round spells into standard actions, and standard actions into swift actions. It is itself a standard action to cast (swift action to cast for Dragonblood casters), and lasts for one round per level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;So what if sorcerer's can't use Quicken by default? Arcane Fusion and Arcane Spellsurge are all that you should ever need!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;There's even a fun trick detailed below in Appendix G.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Evan's Spiked Tentacles of Forced Intrusion, level 6 (OotS): A notorious Evocation [Force] spell that grapples enemies and deals 4d6 piercing damage to them per round. Quite the prickly predicament!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Chimeras affected by this spell must make a Will save to avoid becoming panicked, due to the fact that they are not comfortable being grappled down there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Assay Spell Resistance, level 4 (CAr): Swift action, +10 to CLC against SR. When combined with Spell power, Ioun Stones, and/or the Spell Penetration feats, this means you can tell creatures with SR to go suck it. Having all of those is probably overkill, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Orb of Force, level 4 (CAr): A Conjuration ranged touch attack spell that deals 10d6 Force Damage. Suck it, virtually every monster created, you are taking damage. The other Orb spells are quite good also.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rune Delver's Fortune, level 4 (SpC): Do ya feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya? You do now! As an immediate action, you get to make yourself immune to certain things and gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw, or temporary HP. Immunities linked to saving throw chosen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wings of Flurry, level 4 (DM): An Evocation area of effect force damage spell that also dazes enemies who fail their reflex save. It's uncapped for caster level-based damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Celerity, level 4 (PHBII): Strike first, strike fast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Defenestrating Sphere, level 4 (SpC): A sphere of air knocks enemies prone and hurls them upward for subsequent falling damage. If windows are nearby, the Defenestrating Sphere can be counted on to take out the trash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Thunderlance, level 4 (SpC): A force weapon that can be wielded in either 1 or 2 hands, with 5 to 20 foot reach in any case, subject to your desire. It will initiate a dispel attempt if it hits a force effect such as Mage Armor, and uses your Charisma instead of Strength for determining attack and damage. Pretty good for a gish.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Great Thunderclap, level 3 (SpC): Why target one save when you can target all of them?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Melf's Unicorn Arrow, level 3 (PHB II): Best blasting spell ever. A Conjuration spell, ranged touch attack, that deals untyped damage, and bull rushes your opposition. What more could you ask for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shivering Touch, level 3, (Frost): It's not a death ray or an ice beam, it paralyzes your enemy through Dexterity damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Unluck, level 3 (SpC): The target is forced to re-roll every roll he makes and take the worse of the two results. Divination, Will Save, non-mind affecting. The paradox of this spell, however, is that you need them to fail a will save in the first place. In that case, you might as well Dominate them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wings of Cover, level 2 (DM): Grants total cover to you as an immediate action. Suck it, Dread Wraiths who can attack only once per round.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cloud of Knives, level 2 (SpC): Useful when it becomes clear that the only way to save a situation is through rampant and unchecked stabbing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Bonefiddle, level 2 (SpC): It's the world's smallest fiddle, and it's playing just for you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Whirling Blade, level 2 (SpC): Make a 60 ft line attack within medium range as a regular melee attack, only using your Charisma instead of Strength? Fun spell, particularly for gishes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Nerveskitter, level 1 (SpC): +5 to Initiative as an immediate action is great.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Fist of Stone, Level 1, (SpC): +6 to Strength for purposes of calculating attack, plus a slam attack? Good gish spell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Non-core feats:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Reserves of Strength (Dragonlance): This removes any and all level imposed caps on your spell and gives you a boost of 1-3 on your caster level for the spell (your choice) in exchange for you being stunned for the same amount of rounds. If you are immune to stun, you take 5d6 damage. This is not a metamagic feat. This is stupid. Very, very stupid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Versatile Spellcaster (DM): Trade two spell slots of N level to cast one spell of N+1 level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Sherem-Lar Sorcery, and Sherezem-Lar Sorcery: These two feats from Ghostwalk are effectively the pre-nerfed versions Spellcaster Prodigy feat, except they stack with each other. Effectively, your Cha score is increased by 4 for the purposes of spell save DC and bonus spells/day. The only restrictions are that you have to be a female noble to take them, and that Sherem-Lar Sorcery is a pre-requisite for Sherezem-Lar Sorcery. Methinks Fatespinner would appreciate them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rapid Metamagic: If you do not use the metamagic specialist ACF described below, you should pick up this feat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Alternate Class Features:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The only ACF you will ever have to concern yourself with as a sorcerer is the Metamagic Specialist ACF found in the PHB2 that allows you to trade your familiar away for the ability to use metamagic without the time increase penalty. I would say it allows you to do so INT mod + 3 times per day, but that might get me into legal trouble over copyrighted material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The need for this ACF is lessened somewhat if you have taken Arcane Preparation in preparation for Mage of the Arcane Order, or have access to Arcane Spellsurge, but it is still better than having an XP drain on legs around on your person.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The Divine Companion ACF from the Complete Champion would be a good substitute if you have Arcane Preparation, or take Rapid Metamagic. It can heal you and provide a bonus to AC and saves, all depending on how many spell slots you feed it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Solo's Stupendously Superior Sorcerous Shopping List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Core Equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Scrolls: Buy scrolls of spells you'll use occasionally. Plane Shift, for example. All spells that I have noted are better cast by wizards fall into scroll territory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wands: Buy wands of spells you'll use a lot, but don't want to waste spells known on. Make sure the spells in your wands are not Save or X spells, nor rely heavily on a high caster level for effectiveness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shnkeeky:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Of course, any Sorcerer worth the title knows his limited spell list means he needs an extra supply of scrolls and wands to make up his lack of knowledge. Here's a few wands I've found useful...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* First off, recall the disadvantage of wands: it uses a base caster level rather than yours, and can only be up to 4th level spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* Second, the DC's do *NOT* take into account your primary casting stat. So don't bother with Save or Screwed spells, they'll never land.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;* It has 50 charges, so only wand it if you plan on doing it a LOT, otherwise just grab a couple of scrolls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;With this in mind, you don't want wands that have a lot of level-dependent stuff. That means, unfortunately, a lot of your 'blaster' spells. However, there are some very useful utility spells to pick up as wands:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Grease. No level-dependent effects, and no SR to worry about. Flat DC balance check. It's always good for a few laughs. If you don't know it, DO wand it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Summon Monster I. Surprisingly handy utility. Use it to trip traps, walk into dubious areas wherein you suspect might be hazardous, to experiment with unknown substances...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ray of Enfeeblement. Handy at low levels, not so much at higher levels. No save, and not much in the way of level-dependent stuff. If you like using it a lot, wand it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Expeditious Retreat. What you do when something does close with you. At least until you can afford Dimension Door.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Knock. Wand this, because caster level is irrelevant. And you never know when your skillmonkey isn't skilled enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Glitterdust. If you don't learn it, wand it. It points out invisible things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Web. Good battlefield control, has a use even if they make the save.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Mirror Image. Really, you should have this as a Known spell, so you shouldn't need to wand it. If, for some reason, you decide to NOT pick it up, Wand it, and smack yourself in the head for not learning it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;[Animal]'s [Attribute]. If your party wants buffing, ask them to buy you the wands. This makes them think twice about calling you a worthless buff-bot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rope Trick. It would be expensive to get it as cast by an 8th level caster (12,000 by my calculations), but hey, that's an awful lot of adventuring days you don't need to worry about being ambushed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Silence. Use it in the area effect version that doesn't allow save. Follow up with a method of keeping them in the area. Nerfs opponent casters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rings:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ring of Sustenance: Valuable for letting you be awake 22/7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ring of Protection: Better at lower levels. Decent investment until something better comes along.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ring of Spell Turning:Good for defense against other casters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ring of Freedom of Movement: Now you have even less reason to fear grappling monks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ring of X Ray Vision: These ave applications not appreciated by people who do not ware lead lined clothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rings of Wizardry: The level 4 version is capable of double your fourth level spell slots. Fourth level spells are awesome. Do the math.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Armor:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;A Mithral Buckler of Heavy Fortification is quite handy for protection against critical hits with no penalty to spellcasting..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rods:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rod of Absorption - Absorb spells, and use the energy to cast more spells. A good buy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rod of Cancellation - Crafted by Fox News, this rod is a one shot affair that Disjunctions any magic item it touches. Might be useful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Immovable Rod - As with the Decanter of Endless Water, this is a fun item with many uses. Everyone loves an Immovable Rod!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rod of Lordly Might - Useful in the best pickup line ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rod of Wonder - Almost as dangerous to you as it is to your enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Metamagic Rods:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Core sorcerers cannot use Quicken Spell, but a Rod of Maximize really helps out with Enervations. Widen Spell, Enlarge Spell, and other minor metamagic feats are can be had as Rods, but aren't necessarily worth it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Then again, Disintegrating someone from over 800 feet away can be rather nice....&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wondrous Items:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Bracers of Armor: Better than Mage Armor, but it won't stack with your Chain Shirt of OMGWTFBBQness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Decanter of Endless Water: It won't improve your casting per se, but it is always a fun item to have, and will foil your DM's plotting with a bit of ingenuity and a knowledge of fluid physics. (Hint: Pressure= Density*acceleration due to gravity*depth)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Handy Haversack, Bag of Holding: These types of things make up for a Sorcerer's lack of carrying capacity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hand of Glory: Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your have fine taste, sir.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The best part is that it allows you to add an extra ring slot. A bargain for everyone who likes rings; normally, you'd have to either use an epic feat to free up some ring space or... get creative down under.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ehlonna's Quiver (Efficent Quiver). Surprisingly useful. What, you don't use bows and arrows? No, but a Wand is the same size as an arrow, so you can carry all your wands around with easy access. Rods go in the Javelin slot, and Staves go in the Bow slot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Glove of Storing. If you're not getting the Dexterity, this can be used to always make sure you've got a wand on-hand. (Note to self: Stab Shneeky to death for pun.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cloak of Charisma/Gloves of Dexterity/Amulet of Health: Use is obvious&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cloak of Etherealness: Good item if you don't have the spell, but if you want to use it, you have to give up the Cloak of Charisma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cloak of Resistance: Good for making sure you don't die as easily, but same problem as above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ioun Stones: the Orange Ioun stone increases your caster level by +1, for a hefty price. Get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The ones that absorb spells are also pretty useful. Grab as many as you want and proceed to give children you meet astronomy lessons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Marvelous Pigments: Paint your way out of trouble! Finally, Art majors can do something useful. (warning: For the sake of your sanity and mine, keep these the hell away from Dalai, Picasso, Gaugan, and anyone associated with them.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Robe of the Archmagi: The armor, caster level check and resistance bonuses are nice. The SR will be ineffectual at the level you get it, unless you go around beating up lesser casters a lot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Scarab of Protection: Gives SR 20 and absorbs 12 negative energy attacks before disintegrating. Not a bad way to avoid a Finger of Death to the face.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Gem of True Seeing: Replaces the need to know a high level spell for a modest sum of GP. The gem works for 30 minutes per day, which is more than you get out of the spell. If you go out of core, the Hathran Mask of True Seeing (OA) does it all day for the same price.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Tome of X: Increases X stat by 1-5 points. You know which one to increase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cursed Items: Buy these, give them to your enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Non-Core Equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Armor:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The Twilight Mithral Feycraft OMGTWFBBQ Chain Shirt of Heavy Fortification, if you so desire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It is a pain to write on our character sheet, but it is a chain shirt that is wearable, and give you immunity to critical hits and sneak attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;It is a great thing to have... but does it make anyone else feel dirty to own a piece of equipment whose name is longer than that of several real world countries combined?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Wondrous Items:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Knowstones (Dragon): Carry one for 24 hours and you can cast teh spell it carries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Runestaves (MiC): Spend spell slots to cast spells from the Runestaves a few times per day. Fun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Hewards's Fortifying Bedroll (MIC): Regain spells after sleeping 1 hour. A character can only benefit from this ability 1/3 days. Good buy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Anklets of Translocation: 2/day teleportation 10 feet as a swift action for 1,400 gp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Circlet of Rapid Casting: 3 charges which can be used to quickly cast 4th level or lower level spells for 15,000 gp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Magefist Gauntlets:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Defense: 24 to 25 (varies) (Base Defense: 9 to 11)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Required Level: 23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Required Strength: 45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Durability: 18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;+20-30% Enhanced Defense (varies)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;+10 Defense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;+1 To Fire Skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;20% Faster Cast Rate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Regenerate Mana 25%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Adds 1-6 Fire Damage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Rings:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ring of Arcane Might: Boosts CL by 1. Sure, why not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Ring of Theurgy: Better and cheaper than a Ring of Spell Storing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Stone of Jordan: +1 to all skills, increases maximum mana by 25%, +20 to mana, and adds 1-12 lightning damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Cursed Items:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Buy these, give them to your enemies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;The cursed -2 sword is an interesting buy, as it means you can never be disarmed, even if captured and shackled to a wall. And in an AMF, it becomes a regular sword, so you can maybe use it to hack your way out, or give it to the party fighter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Power! Unlimited POWER!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Here are some useful tricks to make the most of your sorcerous power!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Shapechange: Fiend Folio introduces a monster called Zodar that has Wish once per year as a supernatural ability, which means the Wish costs no XP. Fiendish Codex I introduces the Chronotyryn, which get two full round actions per round as an extraordinary ability due to having two heads. The Monster Manuel has the Choker, which can take an extra standard or move action each round.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Limited Wish can duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you, or duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. This includes such useful gems as the cleric version of Plane Shift (5th), the psion power Psychic Reformation (4th), and the paladin spell Favor of the Martyr (4th). Just watch your XP, the cost per casting will add up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Psychic Reformation is very interesting, because it allows you to repick your skill point allocations, feat choices, and spell selection on the fly. This grants you an unparalleled amount of flexibility, but be sure it's worth paying the XP cost. Speaking of Psychic Reformation, it can be used to relearn those spells Sand Shaper gives you. This works because Sand Shaper is awesome and if you don't think so you're stupid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Have you tried combining Arcane Spellsurge and the Metamagic Specialist ACF? You can have a full round metamagic'd spell cast as a standard action with Spellsurge, followed up by using the Metamagic Specialist ACF to reduce another metamagic'd spell to a standard action, which is further reduced to a swift action under Spellsurge conditions. You can pull a similar trick with Metamagic preparation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Improved Familiar can get you an Imp if you're Lawful Evil. Imps can cast Commune once a week for six questions, have a few other useful SLA's, and can UMD wands if you put ranks into the skill. Chaotic Evil sorcerers may favor the Quasit, which offers similar, but slightly inferior abilities. If you aren't willing to sell your soul for power, you can get a handy Pseudodragon. The telepathy is discrete and useful, but it's not nearly on the same level as the Imp. It appears that Evil will always triumph over Good, because Good is dumb!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Saucy Tricks for Tricky Sorts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Skill tricks: the hottest thing on the block since the invention of the Hadoken!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Conceal Spellcasting: It conceals your spellcasting. Useful in a crowd.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;False Theurgy: Fun for misdirecting others, plus it is easier to qualify for compared to Conceal Spellcasting&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Collector of Stories: +5 to identifying monsters is always handy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Swift Concentration: Maintaining concentration on a spell as a swift action is handy if you're into that kind of thing. Leaves you more room for casting spells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;You should qualify for all of these skill tricks just by being a sorcerer and putting skill points in your class skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0f0f0f;

Thus, I have decided to pass on the summation of my experiences as a sorcerer on to the next generation of magic users so that you may profit by my wisdom.Now, I am here to advise, not dictate, the general course of action for sorcerers, such as myself, who wish to attain ultimate arcane power. After all, while it is easier to teach a man what to think than to teach him how to think, the man who knows how to think will eventually triumph over the man who knows what to think.I shall lay before you the general philosophies I have pursued and found true during my time on the Mortal Coil, and let you judge their worth.Who we areWe sorcerers are a different breed from other magic users; our powers come neither from pacts made with divine beings, nor from hours of rigorous study in musty libraries, but from within ourselves. It is ours, utterly and completely, from birth till death. It is one of the few things in this world that we can truly call our own.When developing such powers, I have seen many young sorcerers make the choice of choosing flash over substance, such as the late Dalron Brogue, Evoker – a powerful man, who’s magic had several crippling weaknesses. He focused too much on Evocation magic and consequently was without the flexibility and adaptability necessary to survive in this dangerous world.When we sorcerers learn our spells, it is a process of self discovery: we become so familiar with the powers we develop that we can call upon them many more times a day than wizards, but at a price, for we cannot change ourselves (and thus, our known spells) as readily as they can open their tomes. Therefore, a successful sorcerer, in my opinion, should seek to learn for himself spells that will be of use in many different situations.This way, we need not spend time lamenting over the fact that we did not prepare the correct spells for the day, but instead are assured that there will always be something for us to do. Whereas a wizard must carefully prepare his spells, guessing as to what new challenges await him every day, and at the mercy of the smallest error in judgment, a properly versatile sorcerer will be able to go into any situation presented to him with confidence, for he will always know a useful spell.More than just spellingObviously, spells do not make the man – nor, as my wife will no doubt remind me, the woman. There is a whole world of training outside of the mere spellcasting that will be critical to a sorcerer’s success.For example, it is imperative that a sorcerer learn how to utilize metamagic in order to improve the potency of his spells; my personal preferences led me to choose Heighten, Empower, Extend, and Silent spell, as they allowed me to make it more difficult for an enemy to resist my spells, cause more damage, have my abjurations endure for longer than normal, and cast spells unobtrusively.Of course, I made sure to learn the art of casting spells while eschewing simple material components for the sake of self sufficiency, and studied Spellcraft extensively, as well as gaining degrees in Spell Focus for the schools of Illusion and Transmutation from the Institute of Arcane Studies – mainly so I could full the pre-requisites for graduating as an Archmage and learning even more arcane secrets.Notable among those arcane secrets are the abilities to cast spells as a caster of a higher level, being able to turn a touch spell into a ranged touch spell, sculpting area of effect spells to exclude allies, spontaneously altering the energy type of a spell, and increased potency in the ability to counterspell.Good times.Interacting with the worldSpeaking of “good times”, it seems a given that we sorcerers always seem to – by the fault of our own or others – attract attention, sometimes unpleasant, often unwanted, you will likely want to invest heavily in the skill of lying. I cannot tell you how many orcs, ogre chieftains, or mercenaries I have had to face in my life, and bluffing my way out of the sticky situations has proven to be an excellent alternative to spells, for they leave fewer enemies, dead bodies, and trail for later trackers.Knowledge of the Arcane and Spellcraft are, of course, nearly mandatory subjects to master, as sorcerers, by definition, will dabble extensively in mysteries of the magic, both to develop their own powers and to understand the secrets of others. As the old saying goes, if you know your enemy and yourself, you will be assured victory in even a hundred battles.Even though most of us have neither the time nor strength to devote to melee combat, I would advise any sorcerer to lean, at the least, how to cast a spell while defending himself against an attacker, for you cannot always expect to have a ally guarding you while you rain magical death down upon your foes. It sucks to be attacked by something, and you should make every preparation against it, but the real world is not fair, and you will find yourself alone and under attack by some hostile force despite your best plans.Prepare for it well.Managing by yourselfWhile on the topic of being alone, it would be wise of you to consider how to balance self sufficiency with interdependence. It has been my principal to make sure that, without any magical gear of any sort, I would, with my bare hands and the arcane powers within me, be able to perform my magics without hindrance, as I fully anticipate not being with, or running out of, material components and focuses for spells, or having my items stolen, dispelled, or disjunctioned. It is, after all, absurd to expect that a worthy opponent will not try to separate you from your spell components, focuses, items, and, for wizards, spell books.Thus, I would advise you to use magic items to compliment your spells known, but never to have a magic item compensate for a hole in your magic. The outsourcing of a critical component has caused more than one company and nation woe, and it would behoove you not to repeat the mistake.(An aside: one of the most hilarious moments in my entire career was when I bluffed one of my first adventuring parties and our antagonist into thinking that I was a wizard, lugging around a huge spellbook and all, filled with runes. When he separated me fromthe spellbook after a long fight during which all my spells had been exhausted, he made the mistake of allowing me to rest for a night before coming in to wave the captured spellbook in my face and taunt me about it. Needless to say, the Empowered Magic Missile I delivered to his face came as a complete surprise.)It doesn't have to be lonely at the topI have now written at length of the necessity of being self sufficient; but I must tell you of the need for co-operation and collaboration with your peers, for truly, no man is an island.To compensate for our weaknesses and shortcomings, such as the inability to “mix it up with the best of them”, kick down doors, heal the wounded, and turn the undead, it would be a prudent decision to associate with those who can, thereby forming a team, whose intraparty synergy will hopefully create a force that is more than the sum of its parts.In my most recent misadventure, I was accompanied by two great warriors and a powerful cleric, all of whom helped me accomplish tasks and overcome difficulties that I would never have been able to pass by myself. I am deeply indebted to all of them.That being said, the ideal associates you will be working with should include:• At least one healer who won't need babysitting in combat. I favor clerics.• A scout or “sneaky” type of character for scouting and reconnaissance. As they will often get into danger above their heads, I favor interns. Scantily clad, leather wearing, busy, female interns...• A dedicated combat type - perhaps a druid or another cleric, though my cousin Saal the Barbarian, knows no magic yet breaks skulls well enough.• Perhaps another sorcerer, or wizard, to compensate for your lack of spells known and additional ways to rain magical death down upon your enemies. Or a bard, if he can sing really well.Oddly enough, the entire party of diverse individuals will often be recruited from a local drinking establishment. Why this is so, I have no idea, but that is how the world works.I digress.What you doAs you can see, everyone has a role. Clerics heal, fighters fight, sneaks sneak, bards sing, and monks run really quickly.But what of your role? What do you contribute to the party?Well, as a sorcerer, your job is to “cast the spells that makes the peoples fall down!”With your ability to cast many spells, you can afford to hex, curse, or blast at the enemy over and over until he is incapacitated, crippled, or dead. This is what you bring to the party; the ability to control and dominate the enemy with gratuitous amounts of magic, making it easier for your side to win the day.Of course, this is all theory; what works best for you should be decided by yourself.And wouldn’t you know it, I’ve come back to the issue of your known spells again.As I do not think this repertoire of wisdom would be complete without at least a brief rundown of the best spells available to you as a sorcerer, I shall give you my personal list of spells known and other candidates that you may want to consider depending on your personal style.First off, you must decide which schools to select spells from. The general answer is “All of them!”, but you will want to focus more heavily on some schools than others.Conjuration is a great general purpose school, with a bit of everything, so it is always useful to select spells from.Enchantment is the school for crippling your opponent with hexes and curses, while bending them to your will… pity it is stopped stone cold by Mind Blank and the humble Protection from X spells. Don’t get me started on how useless an Enchanter is against undead.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is, however, a great school for buffing – if that’s your thing. Best left to bards or clerics if you ask me - and does have some good spells such as Feeblemind, Sleep, and Dominate Monster. Enchantment is tempting to some mages due to the fact that it makes having your way with others easier – in many senses of the word.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These people were what Evan’s Spiked Tentacles of Forced Intrusion was invented for.Evocation is the “hammer” of magic schools. While flashy and impressive, all it takes is one protection from energy spell to render you more useless than the Elvish translation of &quot;How to speak Elvish&quot;. There are some good spells in it, such as Contingency, but those you can get from another school.Illusion allows you to make up for the lack of choosing Evocation and Conjuration spells via the Shadow spells, though they are only quasi-real. You can still use it to create Contingency effects and the like, making Shadow Evocation a worthwhile investment. Illusion also offers such gems as Invisibility, Persistent Image, and the various disguise spells, without which you would have as much luck disguising yourself as a hydra with sunglasses trying to sneak in to a beholder only strip club.If you plan on becoming an Archmage with a school focus on Illusion, be prepared to write a doctoral thesis on the subject. Mine was on “Illusions and Invisibility”. For some reason the Arcane Comittee never found the manuscript, but I passed anyways.Divination is one of the better schools, as preparation is half the battle. However, some of its best spells are expensive to cast, so keep that in mind. I usually leave heavy divination to wizards.Necromancy is considered the “dark” school, but I prefer to think of it as being “effective”. Now, I’m not saying you should burn the cities of your enemies, loot their towns, hear the lamentation of their women, pillage, rape, and rampage across the countryside while salting their fields and smashing their temples, but you don’t have to restrain yourself to playing the role of Mr. Nice Guy either.A note: while it’s entirely possible and even commendable to have your undead hoards rescue orphans from a burning orphanage, there really are better ways of doing it.Transmutation is in my opinion, tied with Conjuration for most the versatile school of magic. There is always something worthwhile to transmute, such as your enemies. For a more detailed argument as to why Transmutation is superior to most other schools, feel free to consult my doctoral thesis on the matter: &quot;Disintegration and Damnation.&quot;Generally, I focused on a small amount of damage dealing spells, coupled with many defensive wards and offensive “buffs”. A key component of my style is the use of spells that require the target to either resist their effects (whether they be physical or mental) or be rendered useless. I believe it to be a more efficient way of dealing with problems than by simply blasting my way through, though I will concede that if you force the square peg hard enough, it will fit through the round hole.Now I hope you can ruminate while I loquaciously illuminate the core possibilities.CantripsTouch of Fatigue—While in the Junior Academy, Dalron sparred with Saal and cast this on Saal to make him tired. Saal responded by knocking Dalron lights out with an axe. I leave the lesson to be learned to you.Prestidigitation—It cooks, it cleans, it gets crumbs out of your Cloak of Charisma.Detect Magic—It detects magic. Yeah.Read Magic—It allows you to read magic. Yeah.Detect Poison—Allows you to avoid spolt food and find booze.Message—Pretending that you’re someone’s conscience never gets old.Ghost Sound—Provides a nice, ambient &quot;Bow chicka bow wow&quot; for your Luxurious Love Shack.Arcane Mark—In essence, magical graffiti. Leave it on the foreheads of your enemies and flings: &quot;A Wizard Did It&quot;.Daze—It is a stunning spell.Resistance—The only way to survive cafeteria food.Light—And behold, there was light!Mending—This spell is all you need to impress the ladies. Keep their clothing trim and your's looking sharpLevel 1Tenser’s Floating Disk—Best used for practical jokes involving staircases. If Tenser was alive today, I’d use it on him for creating this sad excuse of a spell. I don't know what that man was smoking, but I want some of it.Mount—It’s a mount. You ride it to places. You can also sell it and run off with the money before the buyer realizes he’s been had. Unless you want to major in either swindling or liveries, pass.Identify—You identify magic items for a price. If that’s your thing, go for it. If not, leave it to the nerds.Sleep—The perfect antidote for when you can’t sleep due to being poked at with pointy sticks.Color Spray—Blind them with magic!Silent Image—Gives you more time to run from angry spouses by blanketing the house in illusory fog.Chill Touch—“I get to touch you and weaken you. You get to hit me with a huge hunk of metal.” Pass.Expeditious Retreat—Run away! Run away!True Strike—Ah yes. Learn to use the Force.Magic Missile—I keep it around for those pesky “class five roaming vapors” whom I can never quite Disintegrate properly.Shocking Grasp—My honorable enemy and worthy opponent, I concede to you the victory! Let us shake on it!Grease—Great for tripping up jocks, or enemies charging up a staircase at you—not that the two are mutually exclusive. Also, useful for lubrication.Shield, Mage Armor—No one will suspect that the man in a dress is abnormally hard to hit!Charm Person—“Barkeep, you don’t need to see our identification.”Enlarge Person—Growth hormones!Ray of Enfeeblement—Jock-b-ware.Level 2Tasha's Hideous Laughter—Why so serious? Let's put a smile on that face!Resistance to Energy—Alas, poor Dalron’s second greatest foe.Alter Self—not only does this allow you to disguise yourself, but you can pretend to be of a different species. Gaining the scaly hide of a Troglodyte without its stench is never a bad thing.Among its other uses is disguising yourself as an old lady and letting your purse be snatched by thieves while it contains a few notes worth of Explosive Runes.Bull’s Strength, Bear’s Endurance, Cat’s Grace—My voice gives me super strength!Darkness—Provides concealment and DR10/Magic Missile.Blindness/Deafness—I do not see the see the appeal of this spell, nor have I heard of anyone getting good mileage out of it.Shatter—Have you ever seen a jerk who bullied you as a kid buy an obscenely expensive ring to present to his bride at their wedding, only to have it shatter mysteriously at the altar? Fun times, fun times.Gust of Wind—It will blow you away.Magic Mouth—No, not that kind.Silence—Invisibility—a great spell until Greater Invisibility is on the table, as it allows you to go to places you normally couldn’t go, such as the women’s shower.Mirror Image—Greetings, Mr. Anderson. Today, you’ll be fighting me. Me, me, me, me, me.Hypnotic Pattern—Bards? Who needs bards?Minor Image—The cake is a lie!Detect Thougths—Ah, your thoughts betray you.See Invisibility—It helps detect peeping toms in showers, if nothing else.Glitterdust—Just because you can see invisible things doesn’t mean others can. Also blinds whatever gets hit by it. As some of us have found out the hard way, invisibly sneaking into a shower containing sorceresses who know both spells is not a good idea.Web—Spider web, spider web, does whatever a spider's can. Spins a web, any size, catches thieves just like flies. Here comes the spider web.Pyrotechnics—It makes things that are on fire dangerous to your enemies. However, in this cruel and unjust world of ours, enemies are often nor on or near fire consistently. Fortunately, Fireball can burninate from very far away. Also handy if you want to save a town by putting out a fire or fire elemental.Acid Arrow—Handy, but I’ve never found a use for it, except when Extended in special circumstances. I will note though that you can use it to hit others from faaaaar off, which means you are less likely to be poked with a pointy stick.Scorching Ray—Dalron’s favorite spell when we were rooming together in the Junior Academy for Arcane Studies, and a powerful damage dealing spell, for the level, anyways. It is a great way to roast troll flesh, which doesn’t actually taste half bad with a little Prestidigitation thrown on for flavor.Level 3Fly—Up, up, up and away!Phantom Steed—Hail Shadowfax, king of horses, now with wings.Major Image—A most versatile and amusing spell as it contains auditory, olfactory, and thermal components. One student at the Arcane Institute had a tenancy to surprise intruders to his dorm by summoning an illusory fire around them. Since no one would actually dare to interact with the illusion to determine if it was real or not, it left them in the hot seat.&amp;nbsp;Deeper Slumber—Arcane focus: your professor’s lecture.Heroism—My voice knows kung fu.Hold Person—When one of the nobles at my local bar started giving gave me a hard time for getting all the ladies, I proceeded to stunned him, lift his robes over his head, and then walked away. No more was necessary.Shrink Item—Shrinking large things and carrying them in your pocket does have uses. I remember that I was once fighting this witch whom I killed her by flying up in the air, invisible, and then dropping a shrunken house onto her, dismissing the spell as the house was en route to the ground.Slow—Stopping things from reaching your is always a plus. It also works on undead, as it is not a mind-affecting spell. Best use, though, is at sporting competitions.Haste—Speedhack.Stinking Cloud—Not only does this cripple wizards and prevent them from casting spells, but has many applications in the realm of practical jokes. As a freshman at the Institute of Arcane Studies, there was a brief period where you could not trust the food at the dining hall because some anonymous student would find a way of slipping Beans of Stinking Cloud into the day’s meals.Explosive Runes—Someone set us up the bomb! Makes for a great impromptu booby trap, way of paying a check with an unpleasant restaurant or shopkeeper, and ensuring that your letter self destructs after it is read.Note: make sure that the recipient can survive an explosion before mailing the letter.Dispel Magic—A lifesaver if you need to clear hallways of Stinking Clouds.Protection from Energy—Alas, poor Dalron’s greatest foe.Fireball—Another of Dalron’s mainstays, this is a respectable spell for troubleshooting at long distances. Solving problems from far away is generally regarded as a good thing.Ray of Exhaustion—Jock-b-goneVampiric Touch—All your health is belong to me.Wind Wall—Take pride in rendering Elfy McElf, the Elvish archer utterly obsolete.Level 4Enervation—Yes, it’s channeling the blackest of energies to cripple an opponent, making it an evil act. That being said, it is also a very effective spell. Learn it and let the Student Honor Council debate the ethics of using it. Empower for greater effect only if you can suppress the urge to spout out villainous laughter as you do so.Greater Invisibility—Being unseen in the presence of a great and powerful monster is good. Nowadays, however, most of the opponents I face have ways to see through or negate Invisibility, so I usually spend it in attempts to avoid unwelcome relatives.Resilient Sphere—It protects and traps pretty much any one creature, even incorporeal or ethereal ones. No need to call ghost busters to trap your focused, non-terminal repeating phantasms anymore.Black Tentacles—In my younger days, I once managed to restrain a succubus with this spell. It proved effective, though not in the manner I was expecting.Dimension Door—To quote the headmaster, “Great for getting you out of trouble—or into it.”Solid Fog—The most solid of the fog spells.Scrying—A great information gathering spell, but not something you will use all the time. Leave it to the book nerds.Phantasmal Killer—The only person scared to death was me after I learned it required two saves to take effect.Charm Monster—Great for gathered information, incapacitating the enemy, making friends, and bending people to your will, though a bottle of dwarven fire whisky and a few glasses has about the same effect.Confusion—Your enemy will hurt themselves in their confusion! It is super effective!Polymorph—The most effective way of turning into a troll outside of joining 4chan.Level 5Feeblemind—Cast it on other magic users to humiliate them, or cast on your friendly meat shield to make him smarter. (I kid, Saal, I kid.)Wall of Force—An absolutely fantastic spell. I have used it to trap monsters (with the powers of geometry), corner enemies in an Antimagic Field, and more. It may very well save your life, and help you end someone else’s. Remember, when casting a Wall of Force, NONE SHALL PASS!Wall of Stone: It rocks.Telekinesis—Can be used to manipulate things from far away, trip, disarm, pin down, or bull rush opponents (preferably into a Prismatic Sphere), and scratch those hard to reach places on your back.Persistent Image—Illusions are good and useful. Ever wanted to get out of dinner with your mother in law?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Here you go!Dominate Person—You will go home and rethink your life.Hold Monster—Stupefy!Cloudkill—If you ever face off against hoards of minions, by all means invite them to pull your finger.Lesser Planar Binding–More like Lesser Planar Bondage, if you know what I mean. You should have the charisma to take advantage of it, unlike those nerdy wizards. Give other people Nightmares!Baleful Polymorph—Turn your enemies into newts. They won't get better.Contact Other Plane: Great spell… but are you going to use it every day? Of course not, you're not a nerd!Level 6Disintegrate—As often said amongst the students of the Arcane Institute, “Handy for getting obstacles, objects, and people out of the way.”Flesh to Stone—Medusafying.Dispel Magic, Greater—Useful for getting nasty effects out of the picture, like when you fail to resist a Dominate Person with your name on it and are forced to wait several months for your friends to rescue you from a Drow stronghold and return you to your right mind.&amp;nbsp;Shadow Walk—The perfect way to send people to the Shadow Realm. Great way to transverse across time and space for cheap. Best used if you travel extensively and regularly, otherwise Limited Wish may be better.Bigby’s Forceful Hand—Talk to the hand!True Seeing—You see all, but at quite a&amp;nbsp; price.Eyebite—Behold the Evil Eye of Poogly Pie. Whomever sees it shall surely die. I’m glad you didn’t – you did? Goodbye.Greater Heroism—Are you a bad enough dude to be the hero?Level 7Spell Turning—It helps you avoid getting killed by a Finger of Death to the face, if your friendly neighborhood cleric has neglected to cast Death Ward on you. A common sport my freshman year in the Arcane Institute was for two aspiring Archmages to turn up their Spell Turnings, cast Magic Missile at each other, and create a resonance effect. First to get back from the Astral Plane got a keg of beer. Loser had to foot the bill.Arcane Sight, Greater—It is generally regarded as a good thing to know if the person you will be casting spells on today has Spell Turning on or not. Also, useful for qualification for Archmage, as those old geezers on the Archmage’s Council will want to see ‘diversity’ among the schools of magic in your spell list.Ethereal Jaunt—In another dimension, with voyeuristic intention, well secluded, I see all!Limited Wish—For a small price, you can make up for one important spell you do not know. Priceless.Mass Hold Person—Stop in the name of love, baby!Insanity—This is MADNESS!!!Bigby’s Grasping Hand—provides cover, rushes, and gropes at your command.Forcecage—One of the greatest joys in life is to cast Forcecage on a dual lance wielding mounted charger, rendering his entire training up to this point moot. Expensive to cast, though. You’d probably be better off casting Fly on yourself and taunting him from above.Prismatic Spray—Color your enemy surprised with one of 8 dazzling outcomes!Delayed Blast Fireball—Burn everything. Burn it to the ground. There is nothing quite like seeing five of these go off at one time.Simulacrum—Materials for cloning: 2000 gpXP cost for cloning: 2000 XPHaving a threesome consisting of only you and your spouse?PricelessFinger of Death—Avada Kerdava! Bonus points if you guess which finger it is.Maze—Best way to amaze a Feebleminded enemy.Reverse Gravity—If your enemy does not yet know how to fly, they soon will.Level 8Greater Prying Eyes—Free scouts with True Seeing are always useful.Greater Shadow Evocation—Like Shades, it allows you to make up for your limited spells known. Try using it to mimic Leomund’s Tiny Hut while traveling or Contingency if you’re paranoid.Greater Planar Binding-Glabrezu, I choose you!Prismatic Wall—Taste the rainbow, bitch!Bigby’s Clenched Fist—Your reach will no longer exceed your grasp.Mind Blank—It saves you from the humiliation of failing to resist a Dominate Person and becoming the personal slave to some Drow matron. Some people had to learn this lesson the hard way.Horrid Wilting—My favorite mass removal/gardening spell.Otto’s Irresistible Dance—Stop! Its hammer time!Polymorph Any Object—You can now polymorph things into cheese.Level 9Dominate Monster—While some may have an issue mind controlling other sentient beings, I submit that if they are doing some thing truly wicked, a brief spell as my personal servant followed by a Helm of Opposed Alignments should solve the problem. A redeemed person is, after all, more useful to society than a dead one. That being said, this does not work on many creatures (read: undead), nor ones with the proper warding (Protection from X, Mind Blank), so perhaps it is not the best choice for this category.Prismatic Sphere—This spell is simply fabulous.Shades—These sort of illusion spells effectively allow you to know several lower level spells for the price of one, as well as offering you endless amounts of fun with such great spells as Leomund’s Luxurious Love Shack.Time Stop—With a bit of a mind flip, you're there in the time slip, and nothing can ever be the same, for you're spaced out on sensation, like you're under sedation. But listen closely (not for very much longer), I've got to keep control.Somatic components: It's just a jump to the left, and then a step to the right. With your hands on your hips you bring your knees in tight. But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane; let's do the Time Stop again!Astral Projection—Send in the clones! Pricy, but it lets you duplicate of yourself, gear included, and then travel back to the Material Plane (or Plane Shifting back). Caution: Never leave your comatose body in the possession of a Succubus, even if you did use a Helm of Opposed Alignments on her.Meteor Swarm—Finish him!Wail of the Banshee—Dalron singing in the shower will suffice nicely.Weird—Mind Crush! (Not really... giving your opponent two chances to save is bad.)Wish—Say what you wish, whatever it be, it's yours true dish, just pay up some XP.Gate—Great spell for interplanar travel. Superb spell for running away from your mother in law.Power Word Kill—Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja!... Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput.Shapechange—You are everything, ever. Warning: Not for the lactose intolerant.Foresight—My Spidey-senses are tingling!Disjunction—A magical EMP (Exterminatus Magic Pulse) that fries everything, including your potential loot. Only use if you don't plan on salvaging from the broken bodies of your enemies. Perhaps as a scroll...On Metamagic MajorsBy Shneeky the LostVery interesting and useful treatise, I must say. However, if I may make some... shall we say 'counterpoints'?I think you are vastly underestimating the value of certain metamagic majors. You see, The strength of the Sorcerer, to use a witty phrase a good Fighter friend of mine used, is Tactical rather than Strategic. When asked to expound upon this, he explained that Strategy is planning ahead, whereas Tactics is dealing with the immediate situation with what you have. I found it a remarkable counterpoint of Sorcerers and Wizards for a person who has absolutely no knowledge of magical prowess. And so, my humble opinion on the various options for metamagic majors:Empower Spell: I find this to be a false economy the majority of the time. Two spell levels later, you can generally find something far more damaging. There are certain exceptions, such as when the damage is of a particularly rare type, or the damage affects the person's well-being in ways more than mere physical damage. Examples of this would be Magic Missile, which deals Force damage, and never miss, so the guaranteed damage may be worth the 3rd level spell normally reserved for something like a Fireball; and Enervation, which does negative levels, making it an exceptionally nasty spell indeed. Other than these rare exceptions, however, I find it not nearly as valuable as some of the others.Enlarge Spell: While keeping foes with sharp pointy things well away from you is always a good thing, this isn't as effective at doing it as one might think. Consider a moment that it does not work on spells you have to touch to cast, and that even the newest Sorcerer on the block can cast Close range spells up to thirty feet away.Extend Spell: I find this to be sub-par in my experience. You see, once you gain a moderate amount of magical prowess, your spells with a duration of hours/level will practically last all adventuring day, using either the humble Rope Trick or the upgraded Mordikain's Magnificent Love Shack to keep yourself safe once the spells have expired. During combat, the duration is almost pointless, as combat will almost certainly be over before you spell is. In your younger days, when you need it the most, you are least able to afford the price tag associated with it.Heighten Spell: A deceptively useful one, and often overlooked. Why, then, would I wish to cast a low level spell in a higher level spell slot? Why, because you are no wizard who has to guess in advance which spells he needs to memorize for the day and what metamagic to apply at that time, your tactical versatility is such that even your humble low level spells can affect a surprisingly potent foe when dropped into a higher level spell slot.Remember, you are a Sorcerer, you have few high level spells known, but many times a day to cast it. This means that you will often have high-end spell slots available. So when your opponent thinks he can easily overcome the Stinking Cloud, only to be overcome by the fumes when cast as a 9th level spell. In this case, it increases the DC of the spell by 6, which is the equivalent of a +12 to Charisma (impossible through pre-epic means), or an Archmage devoted exclusively to increasing his spell power AND has an Ioun Stone which increases it still further.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This makes your low-end spells still viable and useful even very late in your career.Maximize Spell: A false economy, I fear. While many 'blasters' drool over this one, it's actually not as useful as it may appear to be. It is cast as a spell three levels higher. So let us once again use that staple, the Fireball. A Maximized Fireball deals a guaranteed 60 damage (10d6) as a 6th level spell. Let us browse the list of 6th level spells, shall we? We have Disintegrate, but that's not really a fair comparison, now is it? Ahh, here we go, Evocation has two different 'blasters' at 6th: Chain Lightning and Freezing Sphere.Now then, of the two, Freezing Sphere is the most similar, so let us use it by way of comparison. This particularly little nuke deals 15d6 (15d8 vs water elementals and the like, but those are so rare, let's just ignore that, shall we). Now then, the law of averages and bell curves indicates that this spell will average out to somewhere between 45 and 60 damage. So, not a whole lot of difference in damage output, but Freezing Sphere also lets you freeze water, making it possible to create walkways across otherwise impassible water sources, trap monsters who are currently in the water, and in general has a lot more utility use than Fireball does.Right, let's look at Chain Lightning briefly, shall we? First off, it's damage is capped at 20d6, which means it will, on average, actually do MORE damage than the Maximized Fireball toward the end of your career, PLUS it arcs to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level, each one doing half damage. That's a lot better than the Maximized Fireball to me.Quicken Spell: Core, unable to be used by us. Pity, and the nerds wizards never let us forget it, either. If you allow PhB II rules, possibilities open up, and it becomes an extremely valuable tool.Silent Spell: Always handy to have, since we don't have to guess which spells we'll need to cast silently, unlike some people. Very useful for when captured and gagged, or when in a Zone of Silence, or similar effect. Everyone knows that silencing is the best method of shutting down a caster. Learn this and prove them wrong.Still Spell: Also an extremely useful metamagic, and one I'm surprised wasn't mentioned earlier. This spell lets you cast spells without somatic components. This means, among other things, that Arcane Spell Failure does not apply to that particular spell, meaning you can be disguised as a 'tank' in full plate with a tower shield, and can still flawlessly perform arcane feats of prowess. It also means you can cast while grappled, making it invaluable in those sticky situations. It also means you can be clapped in irons in a dungeon and can still cast.In fact, I'm reminded of one time when we were ambushed at night and taken captive. I was thrown in prison, chained to the wall, and gagged. My tormentor came to my prison and began taunting me about how useless I was now that I couldn't cast, waving the dummy spellbook I always keep on my person, which is always a worthwhile deception in such situations. My response of a Stilled and Silent Shatter on my bonds, followed up by a Phantasmal Killer on my strong but dumb tormentor. By the time the guards arrived after hearing his screams, I was already ready with a Prismatic Wall across the entrance.Widen Spell: Deceptively Dangerous. As my smart Fighter friend used to say: Friendly Fire Isn't. Being hung my my toes from a rather large tree, I had ample time to consider the profound statement, and came to realize that he was a bit miffed about being caught in the effect of the Stinking Cloud I had cast at the opponent casters to keep them from casting. You see, a lot of the things you're casting works do not come equipped with a method of identifying friend from foe. Expanding the radius of the effect only compounds the problem further. And before one points out the example of the Archmage's Mastery of Shaping to negate this problem, may I point out that your associates would likely want to move around, rather than be stuck in the same small area that was exempted for their benefit? Also, depending on the duration of the spell, they may be stuck there for some time unless you are willing to spend another spell to dispel your effect. Undamaged, to be sure, but also rather upset with you for keeping them stuck in place.Sculpt Spell allows you shape your spell into several useful shapes, as detailed on a list, for a +1 level adjustment. Totally worth it.Smiting Spell, another +1 metamagic feat, allows you to store a spell in a weapon, releasing it when it hits an enemy.SolonotesInvisible spell is a +0 LA metamagic feat from Cityscape. It makes your spells... invisible.Fell Drain Spell: for a +2 level adjustment, your spell inflicts one negative level if it damages a target.Sanctum Spell: Raises the effective spell level by one if used inside the sanctum. Lowers it by one if used outside the sanctum. ironically, best when used out of your sanctum combined with metamagic (ab)use.On the Importance of Planning Properly for Tactical AdvantageA useful reference for Sorcerers on the choosing of known spellsBy: Pip Tallowberry – Sorcerer, Abjurant Champion, and ArchmageGood day ta ye, an' well met. In this particular section, we will be discussing a significant portion of a Sorcerer's power, properly choosing a spell list which will meet your needs. Many sorcerers have difficulties in choosing a properly balanced spell list, which often results in gaping holes in their defenses, or blind spots in their offensive repertoire. The sad fact is that no sorcerer ever knows enough spells to satisfy him or her. However, with proper care and planning, one can find a suitably flexible spell list which can accommodate nearly any situation.Let us go over the criteria for properly choosing spells:* Each spell must be able to be applied in different situations* Each spell must be something you can reasonably expect to cast on a near daily basis* Each spell must be not only powerful when you learn it, but must also continue to be useful well into your career.As a Sorcerer, you actually possess more magical might than even a Wizard, however you lack the flexibility of a Wizard's grimoire to switch out spells on a daily basis. This means your spell list must be able to be applied to literally every situation you find yourself in.Due to the limited number of spells you can learn, you must choose those spells you can expect to cast multiple times, building on your strengths as a Sorcerer to cast more times a day than a wizard of equal learning. As such, you are able to toss a spell when a wizard might think twice, but you must make sure that it is a spell you want to have tossed in that situation.Also, it is difficult to switch out spells, so each spell must be good not only when you find it, but must remain useful for the long haul, as only a limited number of times can you switch out your spells known list.Also, may I respectfully submit that doing damage is less effective than inflicting status effects? Let's face it, a Fighter with a big sword and the skill to use it is going to be doing more damage than most of our 'nukes' anyways. Let him have his share of the limelight, and cripple opponents so he can mow them down easily.With this in mind, let us look at the spell list with these criteria in mind:1st level spellsNow then, your advantage early in your career is that you can cast your spells multiple times, but you only get two that you know. With this in mind, you need at least one defensive spell, and one offensive spell.For defensive spells, Magic Armor and Shield are the two most prominent. Mage Armor has a duration of hours/level whereas Shield only has a duration of rounds/level. This can be a problem early on, as the Shield only lasts a short time, perhaps not enough time to finish a battle, whereas Mage Armor will at least last the fight. Later on, you will find you can cast a Mage Armor early in the day, and have it last all day long, not needing to cast it in combat, making it very convenient. However, Shield is one of the very few methods to foil a Magic Missile spell, which can kill a fragile sorcerer in one hit at lower levels, or severely wound even at higher levels, and never misses. I would suggest choosing one of these two spells, but probably not both.For Offensive punch, you have a wide number of options, depending on how you feel like doing things.For straight blasting, the old reliable Magic Missile is always a decent choice. It always hits, it always does damage, it always affects the target. It might not be one to pick up immediately, due to it's low damage output compared to a crossbow, but it is a staple for a reason. Certainly pick this up soon.Burning Hands is your first chance to do damage to multiple opponents, but it's not as good as it may seem. You see, you are typically not going to be on the front line. That means your friends are likely to be in the area along with your foes. That's a very bad thing.Shocking Grasp is somewhat better, but requires you to touch your opponent. Particularly early in your career, the very last thing you want to do is get within melee range with something that has a weapon. It is, however, fun at parties.Chill Touch, the necromancer's first step, has the same problem as Shocking Grasp. The last thing you want to do is get close enough to touch someone hostile, because they will be swinging something big and dangerous at you.If you prefer something other than damage to disable your opponents, you've got some good optionsSleep. At the very beginning of your career, absolutely one of the most powerful spells in your potential repertoire. Later in your career, absolutely worthless. The early power of this spell is such that you may well consider taking it to start with, using an opportunity later in your career to switch it out with something more useful.Grease. Very useful throughout your entire career. Many things are not particularly agile, and this is one of the spells which ignores spell resistance. I've used the humble Grease spell to disable even a mighty Balor before. Do not underestimate it's power. It is also extremely versatile, useful in a wide number of situations.Color Spray. Not as powerful as Sleep, nor as easy to aim, but useful for far longer in your career.Ray of Enfeeblement. Starts off fairly good, but it's power starts to wane, as it only applies a penalty, not actual stat damage. Still, even later in your career, handy to pair with Ray of Exhaustion to cripple the combat potential of a particularly strong foe.Once you are able to widen your knowledge of the first level of spells, there are some very handy utility spells you may want to pick up as wellTrue Strike. When that ray absolutely, positively has to hit it's target. It practically guarantees a hit. Very handy.Feather Fall. Because the best way of avoiding attacks is to be above them out of reach. And because opponent casters sometimes know Dispel Magic. Remember, this can be cast on others, like the Rogue who just triggered the pit trap.Comprehend Languages. Because it's always nice to know if they're discussing letting you go or how you would taste in the stew.Enlarge Person. Surprisingly useful. Cast on your 'meat shield', and watch him stomp the bad guys flat. It also makes him draw fire, leaving you unmolested to continue casting.Alarm. Because being asked to sit second watch sucks. In general, however, not really worth it to learn. Rope Trick is much better, and is just next level.Summon Monster I. Extremely useful. Everything from trap-tripping at a safe distance to creating flanking opportunities for your rogue.2nd level spellsAt this level are a wide number of options, depending on what you want to do.Defensive Spells you may want:If you are being plagued by a certain flavor of elemental damage, Resist Energy is very handy. Otherwise, not worth blowing a spell known on.Protection from Arrow. If you don't let them close, they're going to try shooting at you. Still, only situationally useful if you don't run across many archers.Mirror Image. Get this first. This spell is your most useful defensive spell in your entire career. Let's look at numbers, shall we? Displacement, which you don't get until next spell level, gives you at 50% chance of not being hit. This spell summons 1d4+1/3 levels images that they might hit. This means, if you are unlucky, you have two other images, so you only have a 33% chance of being hit. If you roll well, the odds of you being hit after being targeted go down to 12.5%, making it in every way superior.Invisibility. Extraordinarily useful for many different situations. The party rogue will also beg you for it.And now for some offensive punchThe two staple ray damage spells are here at this level: Melf's Acid Arrow and Scorching Ray. The Acid Arrow only does 2d6, although persisting damage for a round or two. The Scorching Ray, on the other hand, does 4d6, and later on can have up to three rays for a total of 12d6 if all three hit. Acid Arrow does acid damage, which is rare to encounter resistance against AND ignores spell resistance. Scorching Ray does all of it's damage up front, and generally has more damage output, but is subject to spell resistance and fire is the most often protected against flavor to throw. If you insist, choose one OR the other, you don't have enough spells known to grab both.Glitterdust is both offensive and utility. Not only does it blind foes, but it also reveals invisible things. Extremely handyWeb. A very valuable 'crowd control' spell which also does not allow spell resistance.Hideous Laughter. It's always dangerous to get too close, but if they fail their save, they're not going to be hurting you anyways. This is good for shutting down pesky rogues with high reflex saves or big dumb fighter types.Touch of Idiocy. Your first actual stat damage spell, and one specifically targeting other casters. Too bad you have to touch them for it to affect them, but dropping their primary casting stat 1d6 is always a worthwhile thing.Shatter. Ahh, the many wondrous and splendor'd things one may do with this spell. Even does damage to crystalline beings and golems, and one of the very few spells which does.Blindness/Deafness. It is very difficult to hit what you cannot see. The Fort save makes it ideal for hitting opponent casters or pesky rogues with. Not so much for the charging barbarians, though.Scare. Often overlooked. While not very valuable later on, for the same reason Sleep is nearly worthless later on, Fear effects are crippling for opponents, and no friendly fire.And there is some very useful Utility spells you may be interested in picking upRope Trick. This is one of my favorite early spells, getting this after I get Mirror Image. While I don't contribute much offensive punch, I guarantee we won't be jumped in our sleep, allowing us to sleep soundly. Only problem is you can't bring an animal companion or beast of burden up the rope easily.See Invisible. So you know if you need to Glitterdust somethingAlter Self. While I've never used it, by virtue of my allergy to cheese, it's easily the most overpowered spell of this level. +8 to natural armor, and all.{Animal}'s {stat}. In general, not useful for you to learn, however the Con bonus is always a useful thing for everyone. More hit points is good. Note: The +Cha spell does *NOT* increase the DC of your spells, don't bother with itLevitate. Your first opportunity to rise above your foes. Not too useful, though. Wait until next level.Knock. Extremely situational, and isn't that why you brought a Rogue along with the party? Wand it if you feel so inclined, but never learn it.3rd LevelAhh, many staples are to be found here, you start to really hit your stride with some potent choices. Choosing the right ones out of this level is always difficult, because there are so many good choices. Whatever you do, make sure that you keep all your bases covered.Defensive CapabilityProtection from Energy. It isn't the best choice, unless you're really seeing a lot of energy damage.Magic Circle of Protection from Alignment. Let the Cleric or the Wizard pick this up, you've got too many other choices in front of you.Nondetection. Every time you cast it, it's 50 gold. It adds up. If you cast it enough for it to be worth it to know, you're going to have to insist on compensation for all the money going down the drain.Wind Wall. Protection from Arrows' bigger brother. Complete immunity to projectiles. Handy when paired with flying. Also difficult to get the combo off and still contribute meaningfully to the party.Displacement. We already covered this, Mirror Image is superior.Invisibility Sphere. Good for cloaking the party, assuming everyone gets real friendly.Gaseous Form. Handy, but also really cramps your casting ability. Probably not worth it.Offensive Punch. Got a lot of options here, and some good old classicsFireball and Lightning bolt are both here. Pick one or the other up, not both. You have too many other things to get this level to remain balanced, getting both will cripple you. However, these are staples because they are effective against crowds.Explosive Runes. Almost utility, but it's probably Abjuration's only spell that actually does damage, so I'll go ahead and list it as offensive. Best of all, anyone reading it doesn't get a save, so it'll even bag rogues. It's a lot of fun, but hard to fit into a sorcerer's limited number of spells known.Sleet Storm. It ignores SR, which makes it handy, and it forces balance checks, making it Grease's bigger brother, and it blocks line of sight, keeping you from being hit by obnoxious attacks.Stinking Cloud. Oh my, the fun I've had with this one. It requires a Fort save. Against barbarians, not the best choice of weapon. Against rogues and casters, however, priceless. A distinct lack of allowing SR means it remains useful even late into your career. One of the better battlefield control spells, and one I suggest you find a way of duplicating.Hold Person. Nah, let the Cleric do this, he gets it a level earlier anyways.Deep Slumber. While Sleep attacks are vicious, the limit on HD is crippling at this point in your career. Sadly, probably not worth it.Ray of Exhaustion. How to stop a charging barbarian, other than by taking his credit card. Even if he makes his save, he's still fatigued. Either way, he's taking penalties to Strength and Dex. As nice as that is, there's probably better things to learn. But if you want to be a ray specialist, this is one to pick up.Haste. It's a buff, but a very nasty one. Your entire party gets a lot of benefits that they will all enjoy. This will almost always out-damage any straight damage spells at this level by virtue of the additional damage the rest of the party is cranking out thanks to the extra attacksSlow. A crippling spell to cast on any big dumb thing charging at you. They get to choose between either a move action OR a standard action. That means they can't take a full attack, which helps your party's health and well being. Highly useful, and *NOT* mind-affecting.Magic Weapon, Greater. It's use ramps up as you go up in level. Casting this on a daily basis on your tank's primary weapon means he gets to spend more money on other things. It will also typically out-damage any nuke you would cast, due to the extra damage on every hit he lands.Several utility options here as well:Phantom Steed. Hours/level duration. By 14th level, it's effectively Overland Flight, as a 3rd level spell. Better than Fly later on, but Fly gets you airborne earlier. Take your pick.Fly. You can't hit what you can't reach. Much more useful than Levitate. Upgrade to Overland Flight. However, see Phantom SteedDispel Magic. Get this. If nothing else, it can be used to counterspell. It can also be used to remove debuffs on your allies, or buffs on enemies. Upgrade to Greater Dispel Magic when you get it.Arcane Sight. Always handy to know if there's something magical in the area, or if the opponents are buffed.Tongues. Like Comprehend Languages, only better.Tiny Hut. Rope Trick is better.4th level spellsSome very tasty choices here. Be careful you don't get seduced into unbalancing yourself.Defensive SpellsStoneskin. Very expensive to cast repeatedly. Not worth it for personal use (see also: Mirror Image). If your party asks you to learn it, ask for compensation. 250 a pop adds up quick.Invisibility, Greater. The Rogue will bow at your feet is you drop it on him at the beginning of a fight. Ironically, not very useful for personal use, due to Mirror Image.Remove Curse. Let the Cleric get this one.Globe of Invulnerability, Lesser. Immunity to 1st through 3rd level spells. Not too shabby. Unfortunately, unless you're planning on a steady stream of mage duels with lower level casters, probably not going to be cast enough to be worth learning.Offensive Punch. Got some tasty choices here.Black Tentacles. Shuts down casters, since you can't cast while grappled. Also severely screws over rogues, who generally aren't too good in a grapple either. Plus makes you very popular at anime conventions.Solid Fog. No save, No SR, you just suck it up.Confusion. Confusion to the Enemies! Seriously, this is an encounter-winner against anything without a very good will save.Resilient Sphere. Offensive, defensive, utility... very handy little spell. Protect fallen comrades, protect yourself if you get attacked, bubble the opponent casters to drop them out of the fight, bubble the charging barbarian. Possibilities are endless.Phantasmal Killer. Your first death effect. Sadly, allows two different saving throws, either one of which will save his bacon.Bestow Curse. Let the Cleric do this.Enervation. Now we're talking! Negative levels are very nasty. This is one of the few spells that is worthwhile to metagmagic for greater effect (Empower). This is a staple in any serious mage's repertoire. Learn it.Fear. Like Confusion, Fear is absolutely an encounter winner. Be careful to not hit your own allies in the cone.And for the UtilityDimension Door. Get This. Seriously, one of the best 'get out of YES' cards available. It requires no somatic components, so you can even cast it while grappled.Dimensional Anchor. A very useful spell, handy for keeping opponent mages from poofing away. Unless you're encountering a large number of things that like to teleport/ethereal, probably not worthwhile learning. Do keep a few scrolls handy, though.Shadow Conjuration. With your limited spell list, you'd figure this is a spell to get right off the bat, right? Well, maybe not. Here's the problem. Will save or only 20% effective. Granted, this duplicates a lot of nifty effects, but generally it isn't worth it to get this particular shadow spell, but do look up the higher level one.Polymorph. I can't even go near this spell without breaking out into hives. This isn't Gouda, this is Limburger... really stinky cheese.5th level spellsGot some staple classics in here.Defensive SpellsThere's really no defensive spells at this level. It's all offensive and utility.Offensive Spells:Dismissal. Two problems with this. 1) Outsiders have a high Will save, 2) Outsiders generally have SR. Not a very effective method of dealing with outsiders.Cloudkill. Fort save or Con damage, but even if you make it, you still take Con damage. Kills mooks dead. Also handy for fumigating your place. It doesn't even allow for SR.Feeblemind. Tailor made to punk other arcane casters. Drops the casting stat to 1, means no casting at all. Congratulations, you're a gimped commoner.Mind Fog. It would have been pretty sweet... if it didn't allow a Will save. It would have been the ultimate combo, Mind Fog/Feeblemind. As it is, almost pointless.Hold Monster. Let the Cleric handle this.Cone of Cold. It's a blaster spell. If you like that sort of thing, go for it.Shadow Evocation. Most of them now have two different saves, Will and Reflex, but if you want to blast, this would probably be more versatile than getting a bunch of different evocations.Baleful Polymorph. Probably the only spell in the Polymorph sub-college that I can stand to get near. Pretty obnoxious, although there's a few things out there immune to it.Telekenisis. Toss your enemies around. Toss your enemies off cliffs, back into the Cloudkill, into a Prismatic Wall/Sphere...Utility SpellsBreak Enchantment. Let the Cleric handle this.Teleport. If you get this, you will be the party's port bi... erm, I mean Taxi Cab. However, there's few enough spells at this level which are really worth it for Sorcerers to pick up that you may want to get it. At least then your party will never lack for swift transportation to known locations.Prying Eyes. Not as useful as the greater version, but not a bad method of knowing what lies ahead.Wall of Force. Probably the only Wall worth getting (other than Prismatic). It requires magic to get rid of, so it can be a major stumbling block if placed properly.Passwall. Doors? We don't need no stinkin' doors.The Prestige – A Compilation of Sorcerous Academies and SpecialtiesA reference guide to finding alternate paths to sorcerous mightBy: Pip Tallowberry – Sorcerer, Abjurant Champion, and ArchmageNow then, it has been requested that someone compile and list the various alternate methods of gaining sorcerous knowledge and power. Seeing as how I have many of the reference books available to me, I have decided to take it upon myself to assay this difficult task.Before we begin, I would like to point out that I shall only cover the material in the reference books which I have, which is to say PHBII and most of the Completes (Complete Mage, Arcane, Warrior, Divine, Adventurer; Tome of Battle; Heroes of Battle and Heroes of Horror).Also, let us look carefully at what criteria a Sorcerer should probably use when choosing their specialty:* It must have a very good spell progression. - What is the point in going through all the trouble to learn additional knowledge when you shirk on your primary arcane might? You are even more hampered here than the Wizard, who gets his 9th level spells first. Except in very rare occasions, any Sorcerer worth the title should plan on trying to get access to 9th level spells at or before level 20. This means you only have 2 levels you can afford to let slip.* Watch entrance requirements - There's a lot of specialty schools which make their entrance requirements much easier for a Wizard than a mage. For example, the Loremaster requires knowledge of a LOT of different Divination spells. Easy for a Wizard to include in his spellbook, but crippling for a Sorcerer. Also pay particular attention to Feat requirements, as you only get a few of them.* It must improve your ability to perform your chosen calling - There are a lot of places which teach things that are... less useful for a Sorcerer. The ability to scribe more spells into your spellbook, for instance, is not particularly useful for you.With these in mind, let us begin with some of the more useful and popular choices:From Complete Arcane:Acolyte of the Skin - Half caster progression. For this reason alone, move along. The class abilities are generally not too powerful. Typical, demons promise much, then you find out just how little they really promised.Alienist - Very creepy, but hey, if that's your thing, it's actually not too bad a choice. Full spellcasting progression, fairly easy entrance requirements. Sure, you lose your sanity in the process, but applying Pseudonatural template to everything you summon for free isn't too bad. Get some bonus Metamagic, which is our bread and butter. Upon graduating, you get DR 10/magic, gain the Outsider type, and some Acid Resistance. If you're interested, apply to Miskatonic U. For some reason, they always seem to be taking new students.Argent Savant - Normally, specialist courses like this spell trouble for Sorcerers, who lack the depth of repertoire to make up the lack elsewhere, but this one actually isn't too bad. You do lose one level of spellcasting, and it's the first level, which does kind of suck. But the truly sucky part of this is trying to qualify with knowing 5 different Force spells. May I direct you to Shield, Mage Armor, and Magic Missiles, all of which are 1st level spells? Force damage is nice, and this will significantly contribute to the damage of your Magic Missiles. Furthermore, it will also increase the defensive value of both Shield and Mage Armor.Blood Magus - Okay, you lose 2 caster levels, which is painful, but at least you can still get a 9th level spell if you're careful. It requires a couple of worthless feats, which hurts more. The abilities are actually kind of on the weak side, really. Blood Component, hurt yourself to get the Eschew Materials feat. Not too useful. Durable Casting - if you're only getting hit for 5-10 damage a shot, you won't need to worry about making Concentration checks anyways. Staunch - By the time you get this, the odds of landing right in that -1 to -10 area is pretty slim. Things tend to either leave you a greasy stain or miss. Scarification/Blood drought really aren't your cup of tea, you don't know enough spells to make them worth it. Bloodwalk is about the only thing really worth it, but it's still only so-so.Effigy Master - Not worth it for a Sorcerer. Too many skills required.Elemental Savant - Oh yea, this one is real popular with the Blasters. Sad thing is, it cripples you. So now you're a blaster, already not as powerful as some of the choices, but you only blast in one element. Ummm... pass.Fatespinner - Now we're talking. Don't feel bad if you have to drop out before you graduate, everyone else does too. That last level really isn't worth the loss of caster level, but the rest are very useful indeed.Geometer - It's for Wizards more than us. Too many extra hoops for us to jump through, and the primary benefits are pointless.Green Star Adept - Turning into a golem, with all the immunities implied, sounds like a good deal, right? But not at the cost of only half casting progression. Before you point out all the immunities again, may I point out the immunity to cure spells? Better hope you can pick up some Repair Damage spells.Initiate of the Sevenfold Veil - The entrance requirements are very steep, and again Wizards have an easier time qualifying than we do, but it is very much worth it. If you haven't picked up three abujration spells before you hit 8th level, then I am surprised. Shield and Dispel Magic are both 'must have' spells. Pick one random aburation spell, then two of 4th or higher. That probably means you're not entering until 10th level or later. But that's okay, it's only 7 levels anyways, and most of the prerequisite feats also help you apply for Archmage. And oh the cheese...Mage of the Arcane Order - Yet another case where the entrance requirements favor Wizards over Sorcerers, but this one is so much more worth it for us that it's worth blowing the extra feat to qualify. Pulling any spell out of your hat when you need it is just too handy for the flexibility-impaired Sorcerer. And hey, it's not like you're going to have to worry about Spellpool debt, with as many spells per day as you cast.Master Transmogrifiest - Friends don't let friends do cheese. This is a specialty which focuses on making cheese even cheesier. But does so poorly.Mindbender - If it wasn't half casting progression, it wouldn't be bad. As it is, don't take more than one level for telepathy.Wayfarer Guide - Pointless. Grab Teleport, Greater instead.Wild Mage - Friends don't let friends do Wild Magic. Seriously, this stuff is as likely to hurt you as to help you. Avoid this.From Complete AdventurerOnly one arcane class hereDaggerspell Mage - Requires at least a one-level dip on another class, and the 1st level doesn't promote casting. This is designed more for the rogue/sorcerers who are more into knifing than tricking.From Complete DivineYea, divine. I guess some Sorcerers 'get religion'. It's generally a bad idea, though, as far as Arcane Might goes.Rainbow Servant - On first blush, it looks pretty awesome, gain knowledge of all cleric spells! But wait... you just get access to them. You still have to buy them with spells known slots. In other words, it's like Mystic Theurge, with more Suck and fewer spells per day.From Complete MageThere's some gems here, diamonds in the (very) rough.Abjurant Champion - At first glance, you might say 'Gish Class, move on', but wait, why is it only for Gish? Okay, it requires a BAB +5, that means you can't enter until after 10th level. So what, it's only a five level PrC anyways. The proficiency in one martial weapon might hurt, although Elves get lucky here. In exchange, you get full casting, full BAB progression, and look at the abilities! First off, your Shield spell gets it's defensive bonus beefed up. How about a +9 to AC from it? Then, at 2nd level, you get to auto-quicken it! Considering how difficult it is for us to be able to quicken ANYTHING, this is GOLD. You can also beef up AC or saves or elemental resistance on the fly if something is about to do something nasty to you. The D10 Hit Die doesn't hurt either.Holy Scourge - Hey, you can blast for a little more damage against specific things! In exchange, you lose a caster level and you get the Paladin stick-up-your-Pigu class ability! Ummm... pass.Nightmare Spinner - Oh, now here is some potential. You lose a spell level, but not bad class abilities. One extra spell cast per level per day, but it has to be Illusion. Oh boo hoo, I get to be able to cast Mirror Image more times per day. Immunity to Fear, because Fear sucks. Inspire Fear, again, because Fear sucks. Later on, this gets situational as you run into more things immune to mind-affecting, but hey, this isn't bad for shutting things down.Unseen Seer - Like Arcane Trickster, but with a different flavor. Don't bother, it does increase your CL for Divination, but dumps the rest by an equal amount. Plus, it requires a crapton of skills, requiring multiple levels of Rogue to qualify. Good for a rogue/sorcerer build, but not for a straight Sorcerer.Complete WarriorOnly two in here are Rage Mage, and Spellsword. Both are for Gishes, which we won't go into here.SandstormOne PrC from Sandstorm merits mention, the Sand Shaper. It's has some interesting and useful abilities, and only costs 2 caster levels in the long run.Taking a single level in this class gives the Desert Insight class feature, which adds a ton of spells to your spells known, covering a variety of uses, including utility, blasting, summoning, and save-or-die spells.Solonotes:Fiend Blooded (HoH): 9/10 casting, but the lost level is the final one. Boosts stats, gives extra spells, and some nice abilities. It requires two so so feats and Knowledge (the planes) 8 ranks. Sorcerers don't have Knowledge (the Planes) as a class skill, but all their example characters are Sorcerer 6/Fiend-Blood X for some reason. Ask your DM to make an adjustment, or take Knowledge Devotion.Ruathar (RotW): Easy to qualify for by level 6 (earlier if using tricks). Gives all knowledge skills and 4 skill points/level for three levels. Speak, elf-friend, and enter into this handy prestige class!War Weaver (HoB): 4/5 casting. Buffing is good.Dracolexi (RotD): 9/10 casting, but decent abilities.Incantatrix (PGtF): Metamagic on crack.Escalation Mage (FoE): A decent prestige class that lets you mimic the effects of some handy metamagic feats.Esoteric Arcana – Additional Tips for the Non-Core SorcererNon-core spells of note:Sphere of Ultimate Destruction, level 9 (SpC): Disintegrate on steroids. You're basically summoning a black hole and throwing it at enemies. A singularity useful spell.&amp;nbsp; I hope you have been practicing your evil laughter. It's all about standards, folks.Maw of Chaos, level 9 (SpC): An AOE damage spell that deals 1d6/caster level force damage and disrupts concentration. Crazy good.Reaving Dispel, level 9 (SpC): All your buffs are belong to me!Warning: use Greater Arcane Sight to make sure you don't slap a Dominate Person on yourself by accident.Superior Invisibility, level 8 (SpC): Superior Invisibility is superior.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Greater Arcane Fusion, level 8, and Arcane Fusion, level 5 (CM): Two lower level spells for the price of one higher level spell slot? Sign me up!Arcane Spellsurge, level 7 (DM): It makes your spells spells take one less round to cast, turning full-round spells into standard actions, and standard actions into swift actions. It is itself a standard action to cast (swift action to cast for Dragonblood casters), and lasts for one round per level.So what if sorcerer's can't use Quicken by default? Arcane Fusion and Arcane Spellsurge are all that you should ever need!&amp;nbsp;There's even a fun trick detailed below in Appendix G.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Evan's Spiked Tentacles of Forced Intrusion, level 6 (OotS): A notorious Evocation [Force] spell that grapples enemies and deals 4d6 piercing damage to them per round. Quite the prickly predicament!Chimeras affected by this spell must make a Will save to avoid becoming panicked, due to the fact that they are not comfortable being grappled down there.Assay Spell Resistance, level 4 (CAr): Swift action, +10 to CLC against SR. When combined with Spell power, Ioun Stones, and/or the Spell Penetration feats, this means you can tell creatures with SR to go suck it. Having all of those is probably overkill, though.Orb of Force, level 4 (CAr): A Conjuration ranged touch attack spell that deals 10d6 Force Damage. Suck it, virtually every monster created, you are taking damage. The other Orb spells are quite good also.Rune Delver's Fortune, level 4 (SpC): Do ya feel lucky, punk? Well, do ya? You do now! As an immediate action, you get to make yourself immune to certain things and gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on one saving throw, or temporary HP. Immunities linked to saving throw chosen.Wings of Flurry, level 4 (DM): An Evocation area of effect force damage spell that also dazes enemies who fail their reflex save. It's uncapped for caster level-based damage.Celerity, level 4 (PHBII): Strike first, strike fast.Defenestrating Sphere, level 4 (SpC): A sphere of air knocks enemies prone and hurls them upward for subsequent falling damage. If windows are nearby, the Defenestrating Sphere can be counted on to take out the trash.Thunderlance, level 4 (SpC): A force weapon that can be wielded in either 1 or 2 hands, with 5 to 20 foot reach in any case, subject to your desire. It will initiate a dispel attempt if it hits a force effect such as Mage Armor, and uses your Charisma instead of Strength for determining attack and damage. Pretty good for a gish.Great Thunderclap, level 3 (SpC): Why target one save when you can target all of them?Melf's Unicorn Arrow, level 3 (PHB II): Best blasting spell ever. A Conjuration spell, ranged touch attack, that deals untyped damage, and bull rushes your opposition. What more could you ask for?Shivering Touch, level 3, (Frost): It's not a death ray or an ice beam, it paralyzes your enemy through Dexterity damage.Unluck, level 3 (SpC): The target is forced to re-roll every roll he makes and take the worse of the two results. Divination, Will Save, non-mind affecting. The paradox of this spell, however, is that you need them to fail a will save in the first place. In that case, you might as well Dominate them.Wings of Cover, level 2 (DM): Grants total cover to you as an immediate action. Suck it, Dread Wraiths who can attack only once per round.Cloud of Knives, level 2 (SpC): Useful when it becomes clear that the only way to save a situation is through rampant and unchecked stabbing.Bonefiddle, level 2 (SpC): It's the world's smallest fiddle, and it's playing just for youWhirling Blade, level 2 (SpC): Make a 60 ft line attack within medium range as a regular melee attack, only using your Charisma instead of Strength? Fun spell, particularly for gishes.Nerveskitter, level 1 (SpC): +5 to Initiative as an immediate action is great.Fist of Stone, Level 1, (SpC): +6 to Strength for purposes of calculating attack, plus a slam attack? Good gish spell.Non-core feats:Reserves of Strength (Dragonlance): This removes any and all level imposed caps on your spell and gives you a boost of 1-3 on your caster level for the spell (your choice) in exchange for you being stunned for the same amount of rounds. If you are immune to stun, you take 5d6 damage. This is not a metamagic feat. This is stupid. Very, very stupid.Versatile Spellcaster (DM): Trade two spell slots of N level to cast one spell of N+1 level.Sherem-Lar Sorcery, and Sherezem-Lar Sorcery: These two feats from Ghostwalk are effectively the pre-nerfed versions Spellcaster Prodigy feat, except they stack with each other. Effectively, your Cha score is increased by 4 for the purposes of spell save DC and bonus spells/day. The only restrictions are that you have to be a female noble to take them, and that Sherem-Lar Sorcery is a pre-requisite for Sherezem-Lar Sorcery. Methinks Fatespinner would appreciate them.Rapid Metamagic: If you do not use the metamagic specialist ACF described below, you should pick up this feat.Alternate Class Features:The only ACF you will ever have to concern yourself with as a sorcerer is the Metamagic Specialist ACF found in the PHB2 that allows you to trade your familiar away for the ability to use metamagic without the time increase penalty. I would say it allows you to do so INT mod + 3 times per day, but that might get me into legal trouble over copyrighted material.The need for this ACF is lessened somewhat if you have taken Arcane Preparation in preparation for Mage of the Arcane Order, or have access to Arcane Spellsurge, but it is still better than having an XP drain on legs around on your person.The Divine Companion ACF from the Complete Champion would be a good substitute if you have Arcane Preparation, or take Rapid Metamagic. It can heal you and provide a bonus to AC and saves, all depending on how many spell slots you feed it.Solo's Stupendously Superior Sorcerous Shopping ListCore EquipmentScrolls: Buy scrolls of spells you'll use occasionally. Plane Shift, for example. All spells that I have noted are better cast by wizards fall into scroll territory.Wands: Buy wands of spells you'll use a lot, but don't want to waste spells known on. Make sure the spells in your wands are not Save or X spells, nor rely heavily on a high caster level for effectiveness.Shnkeeky:Of course, any Sorcerer worth the title knows his limited spell list means he needs an extra supply of scrolls and wands to make up his lack of knowledge. Here's a few wands I've found useful...* First off, recall the disadvantage of wands: it uses a base caster level rather than yours, and can only be up to 4th level spells.* Second, the DC's do *NOT* take into account your primary casting stat. So don't bother with Save or Screwed spells, they'll never land.* It has 50 charges, so only wand it if you plan on doing it a LOT, otherwise just grab a couple of scrolls.With this in mind, you don't want wands that have a lot of level-dependent stuff. That means, unfortunately, a lot of your 'blaster' spells. However, there are some very useful utility spells to pick up as wands:Grease. No level-dependent effects, and no SR to worry about. Flat DC balance check. It's always good for a few laughs. If you don't know it, DO wand it.Summon Monster I. Surprisingly handy utility. Use it to trip traps, walk into dubious areas wherein you suspect might be hazardous, to experiment with unknown substances...Ray of Enfeeblement. Handy at low levels, not so much at higher levels. No save, and not much in the way of level-dependent stuff. If you like using it a lot, wand it.Expeditious Retreat. What you do when something does close with you. At least until you can afford Dimension Door.Knock. Wand this, because caster level is irrelevant. And you never know when your skillmonkey isn't skilled enough.Glitterdust. If you don't learn it, wand it. It points out invisible things.Web. Good battlefield control, has a use even if they make the save.Mirror Image. Really, you should have this as a Known spell, so you shouldn't need to wand it. If, for some reason, you decide to NOT pick it up, Wand it, and smack yourself in the head for not learning it.[Animal]'s [Attribute]. If your party wants buffing, ask them to buy you the wands. This makes them think twice about calling you a worthless buff-bot.Rope Trick. It would be expensive to get it as cast by an 8th level caster (12,000 by my calculations), but hey, that's an awful lot of adventuring days you don't need to worry about being ambushed.Silence. Use it in the area effect version that doesn't allow save. Follow up with a method of keeping them in the area. Nerfs opponent casters.Rings:Ring of Sustenance: Valuable for letting you be awake 22/7.Ring of Protection: Better at lower levels. Decent investment until something better comes along.Ring of Spell Turning:Good for defense against other casters.Ring of Freedom of Movement: Now you have even less reason to fear grappling monks.Ring of X Ray Vision: These ave applications not appreciated by people who do not ware lead lined clothing.Rings of Wizardry: The level 4 version is capable of double your fourth level spell slots. Fourth level spells are awesome. Do the math.Armor:&amp;nbsp;A Mithral Buckler of Heavy Fortification is quite handy for protection against critical hits with no penalty to spellcasting..Rods:Rod of Absorption - Absorb spells, and use the energy to cast more spells. A good buy.Rod of Cancellation - Crafted by Fox News, this rod is a one shot affair that Disjunctions any magic item it touches. Might be useful.Immovable Rod - As with the Decanter of Endless Water, this is a fun item with many uses. Everyone loves an Immovable Rod!Rod of Lordly Might - Useful in the best pickup line ever.Rod of Wonder - Almost as dangerous to you as it is to your enemies.Metamagic Rods:Core sorcerers cannot use Quicken Spell, but a Rod of Maximize really helps out with Enervations. Widen Spell, Enlarge Spell, and other minor metamagic feats are can be had as Rods, but aren't necessarily worth it.Then again, Disintegrating someone from over 800 feet away can be rather nice....Wondrous Items:Bracers of Armor: Better than Mage Armor, but it won't stack with your Chain Shirt of OMGWTFBBQness.Decanter of Endless Water: It won't improve your casting per se, but it is always a fun item to have, and will foil your DM's plotting with a bit of ingenuity and a knowledge of fluid physics. (Hint: Pressure= Density*acceleration due to gravity*depth)Handy Haversack, Bag of Holding: These types of things make up for a Sorcerer's lack of carrying capacity.Hand of Glory: Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your have fine taste, sir.The best part is that it allows you to add an extra ring slot. A bargain for everyone who likes rings; normally, you'd have to either use an epic feat to free up some ring space or... get creative down under.Ehlonna's Quiver (Efficent Quiver). Surprisingly useful. What, you don't use bows and arrows? No, but a Wand is the same size as an arrow, so you can carry all your wands around with easy access. Rods go in the Javelin slot, and Staves go in the Bow slot.Glove of Storing. If you're not getting the Dexterity, this can be used to always make sure you've got a wand on-hand. (Note to self: Stab Shneeky to death for pun.)Cloak of Charisma/Gloves of Dexterity/Amulet of Health: Use is obviousCloak of Etherealness: Good item if you don't have the spell, but if you want to use it, you have to give up the Cloak of Charisma.Cloak of Resistance: Good for making sure you don't die as easily, but same problem as above.Ioun Stones: the Orange Ioun stone increases your caster level by +1, for a hefty price. Get it.The ones that absorb spells are also pretty useful. Grab as many as you want and proceed to give children you meet astronomy lessons.Marvelous Pigments: Paint your way out of trouble! Finally, Art majors can do something useful. (warning: For the sake of your sanity and mine, keep these the hell away from Dalai, Picasso, Gaugan, and anyone associated with them.)Robe of the Archmagi: The armor, caster level check and resistance bonuses are nice. The SR will be ineffectual at the level you get it, unless you go around beating up lesser casters a lot.Scarab of Protection: Gives SR 20 and absorbs 12 negative energy attacks before disintegrating. Not a bad way to avoid a Finger of Death to the face.Gem of True Seeing: Replaces the need to know a high level spell for a modest sum of GP. The gem works for 30 minutes per day, which is more than you get out of the spell. If you go out of core, the Hathran Mask of True Seeing (OA) does it all day for the same price.Tome of X: Increases X stat by 1-5 points. You know which one to increase.Cursed Items: Buy these, give them to your enemies.Non-Core EquipmentArmor:The Twilight Mithral Feycraft OMGTWFBBQ Chain Shirt of Heavy Fortification, if you so desire.It is a pain to write on our character sheet, but it is a chain shirt that is wearable, and give you immunity to critical hits and sneak attack.It is a great thing to have... but does it make anyone else feel dirty to own a piece of equipment whose name is longer than that of several real world countries combined?Wondrous Items:Knowstones (Dragon): Carry one for 24 hours and you can cast teh spell it carries.Runestaves (MiC): Spend spell slots to cast spells from the Runestaves a few times per day. Fun.Hewards's Fortifying Bedroll (MIC): Regain spells after sleeping 1 hour. A character can only benefit from this ability 1/3 days. Good buy.Anklets of Translocation: 2/day teleportation 10 feet as a swift action for 1,400 gp.Circlet of Rapid Casting: 3 charges which can be used to quickly cast 4th level or lower level spells for 15,000 gp.Magefist Gauntlets:Defense: 24 to 25 (varies) (Base Defense: 9 to 11)Required Level: 23Required Strength: 45Durability: 18+20-30% Enhanced Defense (varies)+10 Defense+1 To Fire Skills20% Faster Cast RateRegenerate Mana 25%Adds 1-6 Fire DamageRings:Ring of Arcane Might: Boosts CL by 1. Sure, why not?Ring of Theurgy: Better and cheaper than a Ring of Spell Storing.Stone of Jordan: +1 to all skills, increases maximum mana by 25%, +20 to mana, and adds 1-12 lightning damage.Cursed Items:Buy these, give them to your enemies.The cursed -2 sword is an interesting buy, as it means you can never be disarmed, even if captured and shackled to a wall. And in an AMF, it becomes a regular sword, so you can maybe use it to hack your way out, or give it to the party fighter.Power! Unlimited POWER!Here are some useful tricks to make the most of your sorcerous power!Shapechange: Fiend Folio introduces a monster called Zodar that has Wish once per year as a supernatural ability, which means the Wish costs no XP. Fiendish Codex I introduces the Chronotyryn, which get two full round actions per round as an extraordinary ability due to having two heads. The Monster Manuel has the Choker, which can take an extra standard or move action each round.Limited Wish can duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you, or duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you. This includes such useful gems as the cleric version of Plane Shift (5th), the psion power Psychic Reformation (4th), and the paladin spell Favor of the Martyr (4th). Just watch your XP, the cost per casting will add up.Psychic Reformation is very interesting, because it allows you to repick your skill point allocations, feat choices, and spell selection on the fly. This grants you an unparalleled amount of flexibility, but be sure it's worth paying the XP cost. Speaking of Psychic Reformation, it can be used to relearn those spells Sand Shaper gives you. This works because Sand Shaper is awesome and if you don't think so you're stupid.Have you tried combining Arcane Spellsurge and the Metamagic Specialist ACF? You can have a full round metamagic'd spell cast as a standard action with Spellsurge, followed up by using the Metamagic Specialist ACF to reduce another metamagic'd spell to a standard action, which is further reduced to a swift action under Spellsurge conditions. You can pull a similar trick with Metamagic preparation.Improved Familiar can get you an Imp if you're Lawful Evil. Imps can cast Commune once a week for six questions, have a few other useful SLA's, and can UMD wands if you put ranks into the skill. Chaotic Evil sorcerers may favor the Quasit, which offers similar, but slightly inferior abilities. If you aren't willing to sell your soul for power, you can get a handy Pseudodragon. The telepathy is discrete and useful, but it's not nearly on the same level as the Imp.

The main attraction of natural weapons is, of course, the ability to use them following your regular iterative attacks such as manufactured weapons and unarmed strikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is a natural weapon?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;I know what you're thinkin', punk. Question is: 'Can I get Wolverine before he turns me into shish kabob with those claws?' Now bub, seein' that those claws are adamantium, the strongest metal known, and can slice through vanadium steel like a hot knife through butter, buddy, you gotta ask yourself: do I feel lucky?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, let us first start look to the Natural Weapon rules&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Natural weapons are weapons that are physically a part of a creature. A creature making a melee attack with a natural weapon is considered armed and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Likewise, it threatens any space it can reach. Creatures do not receive additional attacks from a high base attack bonus when using natural weapons. The number of attacks a creature can make with its natural weapons depends on the type of the attack: generally, a creature can make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore attack, one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack with each arm). Refer to the individual monster descriptions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 20.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them (or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary weapon. All the creature's remaining natural weapons are secondary.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;The primary weapon is given in the creature's Attack entry, and the primary weapon or weapons is given first in the creature's Full Attack entry. A creature's primary natural weapon is its most effective natural attack, usually by virtue of the creature's physiology, training, or innate talent with the weapon. An attack with a primary natural weapon uses the creature's full attack bonus. Attacks with secondary natural weapons are less effective and are made with a -5 penalty on the attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a -2 penalty on secondary attacks.) This penalty applies even when the creature makes a single attack with the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of opportunity.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most common are summarized below.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bite&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Claw or Talon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slap or Slam&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sting&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The creature stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually deal damage from poison in addition to hit point damage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tentacle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Fighting With Natural Weapons Works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Haven't met anybody who's invulnerable to a well planted elbow in the groin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main hand weapons are weapons you get your iterative attacks with. This is NOT required to be a single weapon. You could make main hand attacks with 3 different weapons, so long as you have enough BAB to make 3 attacks. Main hand attacks typically get 1x +str, unless you wield them in both hands. Note: You don't actually have to wield a weapon in any hands, provided its description allows it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Offhand weapons are weapons who's attacks are derived from the two weapon fighting (henceforth to be referred to as TWFing) combat option, or through the higher tier TWFing feats. You don't need TWFing to TWF, but it helps reduce the penalties. You DO need Improved TWF and Greater TWF to make more than one offhand attack. All offhand attacks have to be with the same weapon, and it can't be with any weapon you used as part of your iterative attacks. Offhand attacks only ever recieve .5x +str damage, regardless of how many hands you wield them with. If you aren't TWFing, you don't have an offhand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Primary natural attacks are a creature's main mode of attack. This is typically an attack with either the highest damage, or a combat ability such as Improved Grab. Its also typically the attack a creature makes AoOs and standard action attacks with. Primary natural attacks almost always get 1x Str, although some creatures, especially those with only a single natural weapon, may get 1.5x. There is no hard rule for this though, so consult a stat block for more details. In the presence of a weapon capable of making iteratives (manufactured weapon or UAS), all primary weapons are converted to secondary natural weapons. A natural attack that is full (such as carrying gear or a manufactured weapon) can not make attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondary natural attacks are a creature's alternate modes of attack. During a full attack, each other natural weapon the creature possesses may make 1 attack at -5 from highest AB (-2 with Multiattack). Secondary natural weapons always only receive .5x+Str regardless of whether or not they dealt 1x or 1.5x as primary weapons. A natural attack that is full (such as carrying gear or a manufactured weapon) can not make attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obtaining Natural Weapons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snikt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, how do we get natural weapons? There are several routes, such as race, template, spells, and etc that can grant them, a full list of which can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?127463-3-X-Extra-attacks-natural-attacks-AoO&amp;amp;p=7066595#post7066595&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, even the best natural weapons are useless without a means of reliably achieving full attacks. Fortunately, there is also a list of ways to obtain pounce or free movement &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?103358-3-X-Ways-to-get-Pounce-or-Free-Movement&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best natural weapons to get are ones that will not be occupied when you make your regular attacks. For example, a fighter who uses a greatsword would be better off with tails, bites, and tentacles rather than claws. A monk, on the other hand, is capable of making an unarmed strike with any part of his body so he can take on as many natural weapons as he feels like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several classes that get natural weapons, but the best are probably the Totemist and the Psychic Warrior. And Druid, of course, but that kind of goes without saying. The Thayan Gladiator PrC from Champions of Ruin can potentially triple the number of natural attacks you can make; check the fine print for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enchanting Natural Weapons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;You're the one who oughtta be shakin' 'cause I'm about to carve you up into sushi.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amulet of Mighty Fists is three times as expensive as it should be, so it is only worthwhile if you have 3 or more natural weapons. The Necklace of Natural Weapons from Savage Species is cheaper to enchant and offers more options than just enhancement bonuses, but only applies to one natural weapon unless you pay a straight multiplier.&amp;nbsp; The break even point between the two is at 3 weapons or more when the AoMF becomes cheaper.&amp;nbsp; The NoNA does have the advantage of allowing +equivalent enhancements (like Wounding) and can reach a +10 total enhancement like a manufactured weapon, which the AoMF does not offer, if you are willing to pay the extra cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fanged Ring (Dragon Magic) grants INA and deals 1 Con damage on a critical hit, which is a pretty useful property to have. Only costs 10,000 gp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ring of Adamant Touch (MIC) makes all your weapons overcome DR as if they were Adamantine for 6,000 gp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bracers of the Arcane (MIC) allow you to overcome DR silver and magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jaws of the Dragon (Draconomicon) grants a bite attack as a creature one size larger for 40,000 gp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wyrmfang Amulet from the MIC is 1350 vs the 2500 for the one in Draconomicon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bands of Blood Rage from the MIC will boost all of your natural attacks for 2600 gp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Ghost Shroud from the MiC costs 5,000 gp and will grant you a +1 deflection bonus to AC and give your attacks the Ghost Touch property, allowing you to bust ghosts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gauntlets of Ghost Fighting from the MIC cost&amp;nbsp; 4,000 gp and allow you to attack ghosts without penalty, as well as deal an extra 1d6 damage against them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best method for enchanting is probably the Kensai, which can enchant all of its natural weapons for XP. Itï¿½s not even a bad class for melee types. Failing that, if you're a Druid or have access to a Druid, casting Superior Magic Fang will give an enhancement bonus to all of your natural weapons.</content><author><name>Solo</name></author><category term="smallguides" /><category term="35e" /><category term="3.5e" /><summary type="html">Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love My ClawsBy Keld Denar and SoloThis guide is dedicated to Aelrynth, who was instrumental in developing my understanding of the natural weapon rules through his sheer, stubborn ignorance of how they function.So, why do we need to have a guide to the usage of natural weapons, you ask?

Uncivilized? Fools; you think I'm but an ignorant savage, and I suppose you’ve learned so much that it must be so. But still I cannot see that the savage one is me when there is so much that you don’t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider! Is not the way of the savage the most true to us all? Who among you hasn't known rage at injustice? Who among you can dispute that order lasts only as long as the strength behind it? We, knave, are the strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural; it is a whim of circumstance; it is a sham. All attempts to control the world are doomed to failure, for the civilized man is a very part of the same world that he seeks to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbarism ultimately triumphs over civilization, for only barbarism is eternal and enduring. Civilization is but a luxury that can only be afforded under certain conditions. When the march of civilization halts for a breath, it is invariably destroyed by the Barbarian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So cast off the shackles of your oppression by your laws and lords – what makes them better men than you? Who gave them the right to determine your fate? Renounce the coddling comforts you grew up in and be strong like your forefathers. Reject the two faced nature of civilized life, the complexities, the lies – embrace straightforwardness and honest living. Return to the natural state of being in which you can find peace. Revert to nature, from whence you came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;As a Barbarian, you get:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full BAB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;d12 HD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Good fortitude save&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 skill points/level&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Illiteracy: Barbarians are thought so dumb that it’s a class feature! Do not underestimate the Barbarian though, for verily, every Barbarian knows how to fight and those Fighter-levels not only teach him literacy, but the secrets of wearing so much steel on you you can barely move!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rage: WAAAGH!!! The reason you should never ever make a Barbarian angry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast Movement: Because wildmen are faster than the beer bellied! Awesome already just because you walk faster than Elves, so you can laugh at them even in their one supposed strength. Of course, the true value of this ability is forgetting fast movement and instead learning the cat-like lightning strikes at the end of your charges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncanny Dodge: Becomes Improved Uncanny Dodge later. Let’s you stick it to the Rogues (and Monks). Truly, you can do almost anything without being caught flat-footed. Makes you always ready!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trapsense: Sense traps by walking into them, and then shrugging off the damage. This has great value as an ability to lose!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damage Reduction: Useful if you ever need to crash a party through the window. Not enough to actually matter, ever (and Adamantine Full-Plate provides the same, and doesn’t stack so bleh). However, instead of needling yourself until your skin hardens, you can learn to charge at things even better. Or some such. So this has value as something to get rid of.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indomitable Will: A mind of hate does not submit! Works nicely with Steadfast Determination. This ensures that you have two good saves instead of just one, preventing you from being a wizard’s mind controlled buttmonkey. Comes late though, but helps all the same. Teach those weakass staff wavers that it takes more than cute words and magic to get to your...tent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building a Barbarian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arus saw a tall powerfully built youth, naked but for a loin-cloth, and sandals strapped high about his ankles. His skin was burned brown as by the suns of the wastelands and Arus glanced nervously at his broad shoulders, massive chest and heavy arms. From under a mop of unruly black hair smoldered a pair of dangerous blue eyes. A long sword hung in a leather scabbard at his girdle.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Stories of Conan the Cimmerian, The God in the Bowl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Military barracks, fighter academies, and martial temples are the factories that produce warriors for the civilized man. They claim that strict discipline is the only way to turn out dedicated fighting men, that only in order can they be forged. Barbarians who are said to lack the sense of control, discipline, and order, cannot hope to compete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is strange that we barbarians are considered at odds with order. Chaos is nature's order! The great warriors of old did not become the best through study, or focus, or lessons in a training room. No, true steel comes not from practice but from life, and life alone is a test great enough for the mettle of a true warrior! It is in chaos that the greatest are forged, not in the apostate of 'order', that illusion of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Barbarian is strong because rejects the trappings of civilization and order, choosing instead to exist as one with the harshness of nature and be shaped by her rough caresses. A man may travel far and wide, to the ends of the earth, the depths of the sea, and lands beyond the skies, but he will never find a braver, stronger, or tougher man than he who remains uncorrupted by the comforts of civilization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is as tranquil as the forest, but on fire within; as swift as the coursing river, with the force of a great typhoon; with all the strength of a raging fire, and as mysterious as the dark side of the moon. Truly, only Barbarians have the right to call themselves warriors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attributes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;They shall be my finest warriors, these men who give of themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them, and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will be untouched by plague or disease, no sickness will blight them. They will have tactics, strategies and machines so that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot;; font-size: 10pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;– The God-Emperor of Mankind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbarians truly are incomparable warriors; mere two attributes give them all they need yet they can expand their options with each and every one! Let me offer you a quick tour of the world of Bane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength: Truly, this is what most Barbarians rely on. Not only is it the source of your melee hit and damage, since it’s also the primary attribute boosted by Rage, you pretty much want to build your character around Hulk Smash! This also governs all the martial maneuvers such as Trip, Disarm, Grapple and so on, so Bane is especially well-suited to take advantage!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dexterity: Cartoons teach us that agility beats strength. This is not precisely true, but what is true is that acting fast, dodging blows and in general, gaining extra value out of your HP is great added to immense strength. Also, this fuels some Barbarian feats and makes Archerians happen. Ferocious Barbarians can even build around this in the melee! No, not necessary, but handy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constitution: Your chest muscle. You know every Barbarian ever has huge chest muscles! Barbarians even gain damage reduction or AC bonus due to their immensity! This is your primary defense; Fireball? You block with your chest! Sword? You block with your chest! Finger of Death? You block with your chest! With the right choices, you’ll even block Dominate Person with your chest! Basically, whatever happens, if something hits you, you block with your chest, so better make sure you have a damn huge chest to block with! Also, makes you slow to abate…which is awesome because your anger is your strength!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intelligence: Ah yes, the archetype of the stupid Wildman who goes Hulk Smash when you tell him to. But no, you’re your own man and you decide for yourself when you go Bruce Banner. This can be worth it, this can be not worth it. For the savvy hunters who fuel their Rage into lethal determination for swift kills, this is very much worth it. For the Conan who just battles an army and comes out victorious, this is unnecessary. In general, the northerners who worship the wolves have less need for this than those who follow less savage beasts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wisdom: You, who hail from the savage lands, carry great Wisdom within. There is much you understand the city-fools cannot even hope to begin to comprehend. You know why the wind whispers, you know why the tree dies. You understand the ways of the sun and the moon and you know why the wolf bites. This is what you’re trained at. Oh, and protecting your mind is worth all the trouble…unless you do it with your chest, like everything else. Still, you can learn where traps lie and you can hear the breathing of the Wizard who would lurk nigh’.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charisma: Take me for a savage will you? Consider me little more than a wild beast? Little do you know, little indeed. Where do you think my Rage comes if not from my strength of mind? Why do you think even a Dragon stirs in my presence if not for the force of my presence? No, not all Barbarians are withdrawn and weak of will. Some of us have force and the ways to bring our minds’ crushing might down upon our enemies! Indeed, some of us may be peasants, but there are kings in our ranks too! For the Barbarians of leadership and fear, this is the way!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Races&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oomans are pink and soft, not green and tough like da Boyz. They'z all the same size, too - No big'uns or little'uns, so they'z always arguing about who's in charge, 'cos there's no way of telling 'cept for badges an' ooniforms and fings. Anuvver fing - when they do sumfink, they try to make it look like somfink else to confuse everybody. When one of 'em wants to lord it over the uvvers, 'e says &quot;I'm very speshul so'z you gotta worship me&quot;, or &quot;I know summink wot you lot don't know, so yer better lissen good&quot;. Da funny fing is, 'arf of 'em believe it and da over 'arf don't, so 'e 'as to hit 'em all anyway or run fer it. Wot a lot of mukkin' about if yer asks me. An' while they'z all arguin' wiv each other over who's da Boss, da Orks can sneak up an' clobber da lot.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Snotgrub the Ork explains his views of humanity and its failings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as not all Halflings are Rogues, and not all pansies are Elves, not all Barbarians are Human. All races started out the same when the world was born; Humans, Dwarves, Orcs, and Halflings were all proud, strong people in the beginning. The only exceptions were the Elves, who immediately formed the world’s first tea party after their first tree hugging session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Elves are as decadent as ever, while the Halflings for the most part have settled into a quiet complacency, refusing even to venture out of their comfortable little holes. Only the cruel – smelly – Orcs, monstrous races, along with a handful of sturdy – often inebriated – Dwarves and brave Humans adhere to the ways of our ancestors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What race produces the best Barbarians? I find this a foolish question, as there are so many individual factors and variations between the members of a race that is it impossible to answer. The question itself is impossibly vague: best at doing what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, allow me to list the general features of the most common races, which is a far easier task to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orcs are physically stronger and tougher than Humans, though they often seem a bit dumber by comparison. Why this is, no one knows, for surely Gruumsh would have had an easier time conquering the world if his creations were smart enough to do so without stabbing themselves in the foot. However, those intelligent enough to follow orders well are also intelligent enough to question those orders, and that is something the One-Eyed Ravager will never allow. Of special note are the Orcs of Water [UA]; the element blessed them with extra resilience only matched by that of the Dwarves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dwarves, old as the mountains and a great deal tougher, are renowned for their metallurgical skills, even amongst those who have rejected civilization. It is only natural that the children of Moradin, who sprung from stone themselves, have an affinity with the earth. Dwarves are the most resilient among the Barbarian races, able to shrug off physical blows, poison, and magical spells with the same ease as you or I would shake off the rain. Again of note are the Dwarves of Water [UA], for they draw strength from their element, and the Dwarves of Earth [UA] who can outdo even the great resilience of the Shield Dwarves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans, by contrast, have no special abilities; we have not hide, nor claws, nor fangs; we cannot breath fire or secrete poison; nor can we see far in darkness, or even in dim light. Though Humans lack the abilities of other races, they are tenacious and determined, forever confronting and adapting to new situations, and sometimes that is enough to succeed. While Elves and Dwarves each maintain that their respective race was the first to be created, but I cannot help but wonder sometimes if Humans were the first; created by an unnamed source as the template on which other races were further developed by their own patron gods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great variety of Humans out there provides basis for a great variety of Barbarians too; normal Humans are great intelligent warriors of wonderful versatility, the Neanderthals [Frost] of Frostfell draw upon the power of our ancestors, while Mongrelfolk [RoD] are of even greater resilience than the Dwarves, and yet all are derived from humankin. Truly, there are more different kinds of Barbarians between the Human-races than all the others combined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just like Human himself is mighty as a Barbarian, so are their creations – the Warforged [RoE] are made for battle and their sentience gives them the choice of following their creators’ footsteps and invoking their rage as extra strength. Their fearsome reputation is well-deserved; little is more frightening than a machine that thinks and acts like a man. While Dwarves have great resiliency, Warforged by the virtue of being only semi-alive have complete immunity to much that would ail even toughest humanoids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few words of the grander races, barbarians thrive in their midst. Goliaths [RoS], Half-Ogres [RoD], Centaurs, Ogres and the like all produce great barbarians in both, numbers and power. Truly, when strength is the measure stick, size is a great gift. A word of warning though, the larger races lead slow lives; when a Human has mastered his craft, they are only beginning. So respect them for their might, but remember that they lose out in skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the older in our midst, the descendants of the planar creatures still hold fast to the ways of Barbarians. The so-called “Lesser Genasi”, hailing from Faerun [PGtF], have great history as Barbarians of great might. The descendants of the fiends too, while more at home in shadows, have a history of making great Barbarians if that is the road they have chosen. The descendants of celestials though are ill-suited for this path for the contemplation and meditation does not sit well into a life by the sword.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one more mention, of the children of Bahamut – just like Moradin’s made his children of great resilience, so too does Bahamut gift those he grants rebirth. The Dragonborn [RotD] of any kind are grand in endurance and any of the three gifts is of great use to Barbarians of their kind. Of special note are the wings; few winged folk have the strength and resolve to live the life of a Barbarian – the Dragonborn do just that. Verily, the Dragonkin demands and deserves our respect still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of final note are the races who still live in the wilderness like our ancestors; Feral [SS] Human is at least as strong as Orc and still twice as adaptable. The Mineral Warriors [Und] from the depths of the Earth are nearly impossible to kill and strong all the same. The common races all exist as both and while few in numbers; the few choose the path of Barbarians almost without exception. This makes them match up well to the Barbarian representatives of their more “civilized” counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Halflings and Gnomes shall be lumped together, as both make poor Barbarians; Halflings are best off as thieves, and Gnomes should be casting illusions – or blowing themselves up with crazy inventions for the great justice. Small size, small strength and small weapons do not a traditional Barbarian make. Some Barbarians rely on agility, not strength, and mayhap their ranks are filled with the small folk, but truly, can a Barbarian without strength be called a Barbarian anymore?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The halfbreed races are even more ill-suited to barbarism: True, the Half-Orc is slightly stronger than the average Human, but as we have seen with the Orcs, strength must go hand in hand with intellect if anything meaningful is to be accomplished. While Half-Orcs may make strong warriors, they cannot think well for themselves and fail at one of the central tenants of barbarism, the ability to survive by one’s own wits in the wild. Verily, true-blood Orcs are the barbarians of that family. Half-Orcs are still better Barbarians than anything else, but better than bad is merely a meaningless victory over something not worth defeating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-Elves are even worse. I ask you, what is a Half-Elf going to do in a fight, talk himself out of it? Is he going to ask the land politely to give him something to eat? Or convince a deer that its flank is really better off in his stomach? Worthless bastards to a man!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as bad as these races are, the complete antithesis to the idea of barbarism is the Elf, who spends his days idling amongst flowers, smoking grass, and singing to the trees. The only productive things the elves have produced in their entire existence is magic; and even that was taken from the dragons, has caused as much harm as good in this world, and has been slowly declining in their decadence, for it is often said that the old magics were much stronger than the ones they use now, and the secrets of which have been forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much for the better. While magic is on the decline, and civilizations wane in complacency, barbarism shall triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beat your thoughts to the mould of your will.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Leman Russ, the Great Wolf King of Fenris&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Class skills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Climb: You can kill things by climbing to them. Or climbing them. Or you can just smack the caster until he makes you fly. Your choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handle Animal: Cityscape allows you to use this as a Gather Information check. Unfortunately, it means you don’t get to hold people over the sides of buildings while demanding “WHERE IS JIMMY THE MOLE”, so it’s a bit of a tradeoff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intimidate: Otherwise known as 'Klingon diplomacy', this skill allots you to scare things to death. Might require a few feats to be worth overcoming your possible Cha penalty, but there’s nothing quite frightening as an angry Barbarian with a way with words! Your chest muscles should give you epic circumstance bonuses - it has even been suggested in Masters of the Wild (3.0) that Barbarians get +4 bonus to intimidate and be allowed to use their Strength bonus instead of Charisma if an act of might is part of the intimidate check.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jump: If you don’t have Leap Attack, this is replaceable with Fly. You should never not have Leap Attack. Kill things by jumping them! You can also jump on them should you so desire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Listen: This allows you to avoid ambushes and to figure out what’s being whispered behind your back. You have d12 HD and Uncanny Dodge, but if you invest in it maybe the d4 caster you break will give you some nice gear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Survival: TRAPS WILL FALL AT YOUR HANDS!!! Also, you apparently will never have to spend 5 silver on rations or something like that. Trapkiller makes this worth it. See the ACF section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ride: You run as fast as a horse anyway (unless you traded Fast Movement for something good) and Survival is a class skill, so you have no need for Emergency Rations. Let the Paladin Ride on the high horse and fall tumbling down when you run into yet another bunch of otherworldly horrors the horse can't stand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tumble: Cityscape allows you to trade Ride for Tumble. Tumble is much better than ride. Even without Cityscape, max this, no matter how fruity the description is. Basically, you can play &quot;can't catch me&quot; with that guy's guisarme until you get bored and cram a block of wood through his guts. It also allows a derogatory dancing in the face of Elves, and they can't even make attacks of opportunity to stop you!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Cross Class&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bluff: “Remember when I said I’d kill you last? I lied.”&lt;br /&gt;If you’re building for Intimidate, this gives you another +2 at the cost of 5 ranks. And hey, lying never hurt anybody at all. Trust me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance: You may be able to kill the Tarrasque in one swing, but without 5 ranks, 1st level Wizards can still mess you up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spot: The same as listen, except this time it is even more reasonable to shove the Wizard’s gift down his throat and tell him to avoid his own damn ambushes. Only worth it if you have nothing better to spend ranks on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hide/Move Silently: You can kill people by sneaking up to them. Or you can just make the Rogue sneak, and beat him whenever he’s detected. Your choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Magic Device: You can kill people with magic. Or use magic to make yourself stronger then kill people personally. (The Flexible Mind feat makes this a permanent class skill for you.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skill Tricks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clarity of Vision: If you’re in a build that happens to meet the Spot requirement, this is nice for beating on the cowards who try to avoid you, but it’s not worth the investment otherwise. Requires Spot twelve (12!) ranks, which you must study other ways to even be able to reach it before the end of your path. That said, seeing things is a very Barbarian thing to do!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extreme Leap: If you’re a Leap Attacker, this is right up your alley. Worth it if you can spare the ranks. Needs 5 in Jump, which you should have anyways. Jump more!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never Outnumbered: Demoralize multiple targets simultaneously. Prerequisite of 8 skill ranks. Truly at home for those who would roar before charge; then everyone can cower when ye roar!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nimble Charge: Charge over difficult terrain. Grab this. Needs 5 Ranks in Balance, which you should always have as a charger.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Point It Out: If you have the ranks in Spot, might as well, but don’t worry about it otherwise. You can show the doofuses that yes, it actually is an ambush. You don't really care since you're always ready, but Squishy McSquishon might get squished before he can act otherwise. Requires 8 ranks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spot the Weak Point: Great for fighting high-armor characters like the stupid smug Fighter or his prancing buddy the Warblade, take it if you meet the prerequisites. Needs, again, 12 ranks in Spot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twisted Charge: Turn during a charge. Grab this. The guy to your left laughs at you as you charge towards a wall only to recieve a surprise Greatsword to the face! His face both, before and after the blow make this definitely worth it. Needs 5 Ranks in Balance and Tumble, which are both good investments anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feats&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stomp ‘em! Stomp ‘til there is nuthin’ left!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Battlecry of the Killcrushas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fundamentals: Core &amp;amp; SRD&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leadership (Character Level 6) [PHB]: Über [cheese]! The most powerful feat in D&amp;amp;D. Gets you a second character and a bunch of sycophants who could e.g. spread stories of your grandeur and bask in your glory. The true reason for this feat though is that every great Barbarian needs a beautiful Bard cohort of the opposite sex to sing of your great deeds, to improve your performance (and to use magic (items) for you!) and to relieve stress overnight!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Power Attack (Str 13) [PHB]: OMGWTFBBQ?! Trade attack bonus for damage, at a 1 for 2 ratio when wielding a weapon in two hands. This is basically a Barbarian class feature. Don't forget that it actually lacks prerequisites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Bull Rush (Power Attack, Str 13) [PHB]: Necessary evil. You need it to qualify for Shock Dragoon™-combo! Besides, sometimes it’s cool to push people around. Rawr!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleave (Str 13, Power Attack) [PHB]&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combat Reflexes (Dex 13) [PHB]: Wonderful! Truly, life is boring when it's not your turn. You get to do nothing...except with this! Rules state that you stay still on your turn, but this allows you to Screw the Rules! You have the enormous chest to pull it off. Trip opponent, he gets up, make him Stand Still! Someone hits you, Robilar’s Gambit him back! Yes, attacking out of turn is always good fun (for you), especially after a full attack yourself! This lets you do it a lot, and do it while you’re flat-footed!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand Still (Str 13) [XPH]: Good! Forgo an AoO to force an opponent to make a reflex save or remain in place. Reflex save DC is equal to your damage. Your massive, massive damage. Help those fools you tripped to stay down!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Unarmed Strike [PHB]: Ok. Sometimes you just have to rebuild someone’s face with your bare hands. This feat allows you to do just that. Your damage die will suck, but that’s what Power Attack and strength are for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Grapple (Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike) [PHB]: Ok. Grappling is a problem-laden area of combat. Size is the primary means of boosting it, which almost always favours the monsters. Freedom of Movement is commonly available on higher levels. And you open your back to all manners of depravity. That said, Barbarian is by far the best man for this job out of all the non-casters. This also makes the Barbarian the best man for the job in an Anti-Magic Field, period. Big HP, huge Str &amp;amp; full BAB are really all you can hope for in a Grapple. Not very good outside duels, but if you must be a grappler, at least be a Barbarian!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Initiative [PHB]: Yeah! +4 Initiative, no frills, no pills. Simple deal; you act first so that they never need to act at all! Relieve your opponents of the stress of preparing for their deaths and kill them before they know what hit them! It’s best for everyone this way. If you have extras, feel free to pick this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rapid Shot (Dex 13, Point Blank Shot): Yes! For the Archer in us all! Never arrive in a bowout without this in your back pocket. Your usual Hulk needn’t bother, but if you’re interested in making holes in your foes’ foreheads rather than pulverizing them, this is for you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Precise Shot (Point Blank Shot): Might as well. If you plan on shooting at people, this allows you to shoot at the right people. If it’s your career, go ahead. Otherwise, pass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Precise Shot (Dex 19, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +11): It’s ok. This is Improved Shooting At The Right People. If you make a career out of shooting things, go ahead. Otherwise, pass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combat Expertise (Int 13) [PHB]: Necessary evil if limited to Core. Truly, if you have access to other books, you should never need to bother being a smart combatant; this stuff cramps your style, but acquiring abilities to knock people down, hit them for hitting you and so on can just be worth it. The reason to be a smart Barbarian.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Trip (Int 13, Combat Expertise) [PHB]: Awesome! Lets you trip things, as well as giving you a free attack when you successfully trip someone, and another one when they get up. Oh, and you get to touch things instead of hitting them even with iteratives. Much easier, not to mention more pleasant. Wolves learn this whether they have Expertise or not. Prerequisite for…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knock-Down (Str 15, Improved Trip, BAB +2) [SRD]: Great! Whenever you deal 10 or more damage to a target, you get a free trip attempt against them. You see where this is going… As a bonus, you get to pretend to be the schoolyard bully, knocking people around as you walk past. The only difference is that you knock them off their feet with a 10' blade or bear claws. While the said blade/claw is in their gut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reckless Offense (BAB +1) [XPH]: Somewhat worthwhile. If you have nothing better to use your feat on (as is like to be the case in Core), this is ok. Extra Power Attack; it's not like you'd been dodging hits anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exotic Weapon Proficiency (BAB +1) [PHB]: Depends. Well, by and large Exotic Weapons have 1 size larger damage die than normal weapons (in other words, they suck). However, there’s one weapon of interest especially to two-handed charger/controller Barbarians: the Spiked Chain. Yes, the dumbest weapon in D&amp;amp;D also happens to be the best. It trips, disarms, deals two-handed reach damage, threatens adjacent and just has the whole damn packet. If you have the feat to burn and don’t mind dumb weapons, it’s for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weapon Focus (BAB +1) [PHB]: Bleh. Feel free if you’re run out of everything else to pick. Do take 4 Fighter-levels for Specialization if you really are going to bother. Archers can get something out of these. Most don’t. But meh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weapon Finesse (BAB +1) [PHB]: Useless in core, but believe it or not, it is possible to make a Dex-focused Barbarian with additional material! Yes, it involves Chain Dancing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Tools of Trade: Completes, Races of &amp;amp; PHBII&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leap Attack (Jump 8 ranks, Power Attack) [CAdv]: Superb! Quadruple double handed damage bonus from Power Attack if you jump more than 10 feet while charging. The higher you are, the harder they fall!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shock Trooper (Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, BAB +6) [CW]: Just plain Barbarian! Assign your Power Attack penalty to your armor class. Basically, trade blows with you hitting twice as hard and lasting twice as long. Like everything Barbarian, this just ain’t fair!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rampaging Bull Rush (Improved Bull Rush, Rage, Large or Larger) [RoS]: Ok! Take -4 on Bull Rush to knock opponent prone instead. Certainly useful! Although Knock-Down and Improved Trip do place in question the feat’s necessity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knockback (Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Large or Larger) [RoS]: Good! Whenever you hit opponent with Power Attack, you can knock them around a bit! Combined with Shock Trooper, you can do all sorts of ugly things with this!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combat Brute (Improved Sunder, Power Attack, BAB +6) [CW]: Decent when no must-haves are left. Gives three abilities, two of which are ok (basically, allow you to break Hydras; turns out Hercules was a Combat Brute Barbarian). The third allows you to increase the multiplier on your Power Attack in the round after you charge an enemy. Combine with the above to create the Shock Dragoon Brute OMGWTFBBQ™ chain! So you hit someone really hard, and follow it up with an even harder hit. First charge kills a mook, and leaves you in a position to Combat Brutalize the BBEG!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evasive Target (Dodge, Mobility, BAB +6) [CW]: Useful. As we covered before, your AC probably sucks. It also probably sucks some more Charging and all that. If fighting other melee beasts, the ability to ignore their Power Attack is literally a lifesaver. Really enhances the value of whatever life you have. Only drawback is that you have to learn useless crap to acquire it, but hey, greatness at any cost!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deft Opportunist (Dex 15, Combat Reflexes) [CAdv]: Worthwhile. Most Barbarians focus on beating their opponents to bloody pulp on Charges and what-have-you. Some deft ones have opted for a bit different approach though; let the adversaries approach, rip their faces apart while stopping their movement and let them try until they die! For those, Ferocity and Deft Opportunist are great options!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Karmic Strike (Dex 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge) [CW]: Awesome! The only drawback to this feat are the prerequisites. Expertise, Dodge? Phah, you’re a Barbarian, damnit! But the ability to hit the opponent for every time he hits you is just golden. Especially awesome when you did your Shock Dragoon Charge!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Robilar’s Gambit (Combat Reflexes, BAB +12) [PHBII]: Über! Make your own rules, damnit! This one makes yourself more vulnerable in exchange for an obscene number of attacks on your opponent – if you survive. Once again, embodies the Barbarian ideal of “The first one to die loses!” Generally, the man with bigger HD, damage, Con, Str and more attacks wins, and as a Barbarian you have all of the above!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mage Slayer (Spellcraft 2 ranks, BAB +3) [CArc]: The right tool for the job. If you are to slay mages, become a Mage Slayer. The benefits are small, but notable: You learn to better shield your mind and you learn to break the defenses in their spellcasting! Truly, if a mage approaches a Slayer Barbarian, he is not long for this world! Do mind the Spellcraft requirement though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pierce Magical Concealment (Con 13, Blind-Fight, Mage Slayer) [CArc]: World-changing! See the world for what it truly is, without the impact of magic! You may need Blind-Fight, but truly, the mages who would seek to deceive you are in for a crude awakening when they strive to unearth the Glaive stuck in the approximate center of their heart.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intimidating Strike (Intimidate 4 ranks) [PHBII]: You take a standard action to make a single melee attack that intimidates your foe! In addition, you may take a penalty to your attack roll up to your base attack bonus, and add it to the intimidate check. Useful with Imperious Command.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intimidating Rage (Rage) [CW]: Great! As a free action, intimidate one person within 30 feet when starting a rage, forcing him to become shaken for the duration of the rage. [b]This[/b] is why Barbarians truly are charismatic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instantaneous Rage (Rage) [CW]: Reasons exist to take it. Allows you to activate your rage as a free action, even during other people’s turn. Worthwhile options if your Rage is of a flavor other than Ferocity, when combined with means to yell really hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intimidating Rage (Rage) [CW]: Great! As a free action, intimidate one person within 30 feet when starting a rage, forcing him to become shaken for the duration of the rage. This is why Barbarians truly are charismatic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extra Rage (Rage) [CW]: Useful. Gives your 2 more rage attempts per instance of feat taken. Rage all day, every day! The feat for first level play.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reckless Rage (Rage) [RoS]: Handy! Take an additional -2 to AC when raging for an additional +2 to strength and constitution. Emphasizes the Barbarian ideal of “let them hit and hit back harder!”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steadfast Determination (Endurance) [PHBII]: Yes! Con modifier instead of Wisdom modifier to will saves. I’m sorry, but these *are* the Warforged we are looking for! As a Barbarian, your Rage and Indomitable Will both already help your Will, so the more, the merrier! Oh, and no more natural 1s on Fort-saves; for a Barbarian, that means practical immunity!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Channeled Rage (Half-Orc, Rage) [RoD]: Yeah! One good reason to be a Half-Orc. You can burn a Rage to punch the opponent out of your head; literally! Adds your massive, massive Str to Will-saves. That said, the cost is something to mind; not requiring Endurance is definite boon though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extend Rage (Rage) [CW]: Blah. You can Rage longer. The thing is, Rage is already 3+Con turns. Your Con should be in the lower stratospheres. If you can’t make problems go away in that time, something else is wrong than the duration of your Rage. And if your Con is low enough to warrant this, you might as well start with your memorial instead of taking this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Goad (Cha 13, BAB +1) [CAdv]: Superfluous. Generally, cleaving a line of heads off is plenty of an incentive for people to come hit you. If it’s not, cleave another one. Charismatic Barbarians frighten people into submission; they don’t beg to be attacked. Leave that to Monks. Oh yeah, and this gives them a Will-save vs. your Cha and only restricts their melee attacks. Just don’t bother.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gnoll Ferocity (Gnoll, Rage) [RotW]: Fun. If you somehow ended up a Gnoll, getting that extra Bite out of your Rage is never a bad thing. Although if you become a Bear, it’s wasted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Destructive Rage (Rage) [CW]: This feat tastes bad. You can break things just fine with Rage + Power Attack. Also, you shouldn’t be breaking things often enough to need this. No, this is just bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Toughness (Fort +2) [CW]: Decent. In case you still somehow missed it, Barbarians are all about getting hit and hitting back harder. Extra HP help with that. Relatively small boost for a Barbarian though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Buckler Defense (Shield Proficiency) [CW]: Decent. Making shields obsolete since 2003! If you have the feat to spare, go for it and save the Animated-money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mad Foam Rager (Rage) [PHBII]: Ok. You get to play the “I’ll never die alone!”-shtick! Aside from the coolness-factor, the feat unfortunately has little going on for it alone; if you happen to have a Cleric nearby though, the ailment can be cured. If you had an abundance of feats, every Barbarian should have this, but alas, the limited supply keeps this from being the Awesome it deserves.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ragewild Fighting (Shifter, Power Attack, BAB +6) [RoE]: Decent. You get three maneuvers, none of which are too amazing. First gives you free attack when someone enchants you. Better make that count (better plan is not to get controlled in the first place though). Second dazes your size-or-smaller opponents when Power Attacking. Not bad, but it’s weird if they’re alive after two rounds of Power Attacks. Third enables using Action Points for extra damage. Sure, why not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three Mountains Style (Str 13, Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Heavy mace, Morningstar or Greatclub) [CW]: Decent. The only two-handed weapon style feat; this is actually rather good. You force a strength-based save vs. Nausea, a very powerful condition. The only drawback is that if you hit someone twice already, why isn’t he dead, and if he isn’t dead, how do you plan on making him fail a Fort-save? If you aren’t charging (because it’s been nerfed or whatever), but are more of the stand-up kind of guy, this may be worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jotunbrud (Illuskan or Damaran Human, 1st level) [RoF]: Yeah! You’re treated as Large whenever it’s beneficial for you. Basically, you get Powerful Build as a Human. Besides, you get to be a descendant of Giants! And yeah, you just kick some ass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Final Frontier: All the rest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poison Healer (Great Fortitude, Con 13) [FC1]: You heal a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier whenever you successfully resist poison. A barbarian's massive fortitude save and constitution score means that he can get good mileage out of this, even without Steadfast Determination. This is not a powerful feat, as it is only good for out of combat healing (without employing shenanigans, at least), but healing wounds by consuming alcohol is always fun.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imperious Command (Cha 15) [DoTU]: Yes! Demoralized opponent cowers for 1 round, then shaken for 1 round. This is why the charismatic Barbarians rule! The beauty of this is just beyond description; you need but show them your angry face and they bask in your glory (and you can proceed to decapitate the whole bunch should that strike your fancy)!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frightful Presence (Cha 15, Intimidate 9 ranks) [Drac]: Decent. Whenever you attack or charge, all opponents within a radius of 30 feet who have fewer levels or Hit Dice than you become shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1d6 + your Cha modifier. Combine with your Bard-cohort’s Inspire Greatness to make even greater Demons cry!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martial Study [ToB]: For purists only. Opens up a can of kung-fu fighting. It’s like 10 gallons of pure awesome squeezed into a 2 gallon jug. Some prefer dipping, but pure-bloods can consider this to acquire great examples of Barbarism such as Iron Heart SURGE!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Martial Stance [ToB]: Great! If you feel dipping to be wrong, this enables you to acquire the wondrous things known as “stances”. There’s an especially useful one named “Thicket of Blades”, which enables you to make any movement in your area provoke an attack of opportunity. Never let people approach you again!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evasive Reflexes (Dex 13) [ToB]: Great. When you hit someone and tank your AC, not being next to them when they hit back can help. If you happen to have this feat called Robilar’s Gambit, every one of their attacks provokes an attack of opportunity. This here feat means that you can take a 5’ step every time that happens. So one attack later, you’re out of their threatened area and their full attack is wasted!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidestep (Dex 15, Dodge, Mobility, Tumble 8 ranks) [MiniHB]: Heh. Once per turn, you can replace an attack of opportunity with a 5’ step! Woot! Dodge full attacks! Wait...what manner of tool wrote those prerequisites? Yeah, take Evasive Reflexes. Calling this “bad” is the understatement of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Large and In Charge (Reach 10’ or more, Large or Larger) [Drac]: Cool. Sort of like Knockback! You can make attacks of opportunity to move opponent back 5’ and stop their movement. Easy to pick up too! And it’s just a plain Strength-check.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Righteous Wrath (Rage, Exalted) [BoED]: Just maybe... Now, the benefits are pretty worthless, even for a charismatic Barbarian, as the target is only shaken and only after a hit. The better part is that you can control yourself; mayhap you can tame the Frenzied Berserker within!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dragon Rage (Dragon Totem, Rage, Argonnesse, BAB +4): Decent. When you Rage, get +2 Natural Armor and Energy Resistance +10 (for a total of 15) vs. your chosen Totem’s energy type!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frozen Berserker (Rage) [Frost]: Mediocre if not using trickery. When raging, you become a chunk of ice! Makes you immune to cold. The drawback is that you hate fire. Unless you already have Fire immunity anyways. This isn't exactly Super Special Awesome™, but it enables Frostrager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blazing Berserker (Rage) [Sand]:&amp;nbsp; Mediocre if not using trickery. When raging, you become a living inferno! So you’re immune to fire. Doesn’t burn people you touch, oddly enough. You can combine this with the above to gain elemental immunity to Fire &amp;amp; Ice. Plus you get to be a burning chunk of ice. That’s fairly awesome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cobalt Rage (Con 13, Rage) [MoI]: Yeah! You can invest essential into your Rage to get melee damage- and Will-save bonus for the Rage! Oh, and you get bonus essential. If you intend on fooling around with Incarnum, this is your ticket.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frantic Rage (Rage, Madness-domain) [FoE]: Yeah! As is appropriate, the dexterous Barbarian is an idea of Madness; truly, you must be mad to be agile instead of strong! This feat empowers you for a completely different approach to Barbarianism!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shadow Blade (Shadow Hand stance) [ToB]: Yeah! For the quick Barbarian in us all! Limits you to Shadow Hand-weapons, but luckily an old friend looks back at us; that’s right, Spiked Chain is a Shadow Hand weapon! All you lose is the 1½ damage bonus normal Str-Barbarian enjoys. All the other multipliers are right there. Your Unarmed Strikes also enjoy this bonus, and you have the option of going Two-Weapon Fighting with your Dexterity. And you’ll have an actual AC!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ettercap Berserker (Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Decent. Gain +2 on poison saves and gain an added +2 Bonus to Con when raging. +4 at greater rage. For those who missed it, Barbarism is all about having the biggest chest muscles!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ice Troll Berserker (Con 13, Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Decent. +2 natural armor bonus while raging +4 with Greater Rage. For the Barbarians who seek to block blows with their chest instead of absorbing them!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snow Tiger Berserker (Dex 13, Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Great if you’re a bear! You gain Pounce…that only works with light weapons. Why am I mentioning this? Why, natural attacks and unarmed strikes are always treated as light weapons. Does the name &quot;Bear Warrior&quot; say anything to you? It will soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wolf Berserker (Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Superb! Replaces Combat Expertise as a prerequisite for Improved Trip. Yes, and also provides stacking +4 bonus on Tripping. Oh, and +4 to resist Tripping. Yes! YES!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eagle Tribe Vision (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: Ok. +5 to Spot. Not much to...see here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hyena Tribe Hunter (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: Decent. +2 Hide, +2 Trip, qualifies you for Improved Trip. Handy if you really, really want to pimp out those Trip-checks. Loses out to Wolf Berserker, but why couldn't you be a tribe member in the Shaar and a Lodge member in Rashemen?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lion Tribe Warrior (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: Mediocre. You gain Pounce with a single light weapon, or two attacks with two light weapons you can wield. Ok for an Unarmed Barbarian, but frankly, Snow Tigers whop Lions' arse any day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rhinoceros Tribe Charge (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: For the early game! Extra 2d6 damage on charge. Unfortunately it can only be applied to one attack, trivial later on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headlong Charge (Orc or half-orc, base attack bonus +4 or higher)[RoF]: You provoke an AoO from everyone you charge past, including your target. In return, you deal double damage on a charge. Is nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Might Makes Right (Str 13, Leadership)[RoF]: This adds your Strength bonus to your leadership score for the purposes of determining how many followers you may have with the Leadership feat. If you take Leadership, you might as well take this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class Features Variants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;He is a barbarian, and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-George Bernard Shaw, Caesar and Cleopatra&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Totems [UA]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A Barbarian becomes like the animal he worships as his totem. The limited Barbarians you meet in the pages of Player’s Handbook only give you one option: Worship the Jaguar (they don’t even tell that to you)! However, Player’s Handbook is only a world pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. SRD offers the tools for those seeking to worship other animals! There are also the Spiritual Totems for those who own the path of Champions [CC], but not all animals allow you to serve two masters; although you may discuss with your world master on if you could give up some of your Totem’s abilities for the spiritual aspect even if the book does not give you the tools – allow me to suggest unto Thee to forsake the ability of the same level for the ability the Spirit offers instead. The Totems open to every Barbarian:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ape: The Ape is the most Humanoid-like of all the Totems and thus, instead of animalistic skills, you learn what every humanoid Barbarian does: to strengthen your blows. The Ape also masters trees and puts fear in your enemies, but he’s not as fast nor as careful as the Jaguar on open ground. Unfortunately, the Ape requires your dedicated service; his servants may not serve spiritual totems without divine intervention. The Ape is well-suited for agile Barbarians as you still acquire Power Attack in spite of your probably poor Strength. The bonus to intimidate means it is also a viable part of an intimidating build.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear: The Bear is an intimate animal; where a normal Barbarian learns to avoid, those to the likeness of the Bear learn to hug! Friends don’t let friends retain Toughness beyond level 3, but lenient creators of the world make you acquire the Improved version [CW] instead. In their world, the Bear is the mighty animal it should be! Like the Ape, the Bear is jealous of the spirits and requires you to remain worldly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boar: What defines the Boar is greater intensity than that of the other animals. Alas, this is help the Barbarian does not need. The Jaguar’s servants are plenty resilient and the intensity the Boar adds is nothing compared to the speed and the vigilance of the Jaguar. Like the others, the Boar does not permit spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dragon: Ah, the mighty Dragon! The Dragon teaches you to…frighten your opponents. And to fight without your eyes. And to resist weak magical attacks. Apparently, the Dragon is too jealous of its own secrets to spare its majestic power for its totemists. That said, the frightful presence is not entirely wasted; indeed, the intimidator Barbarian can find some use for it. The servants of the Dragon, more than anyone else, need their Bard cohort to sing for their might. The Dragon is like the others and by the book, does not look kindly upon spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eagle: The keen-eyed eagle is more vigilant than the others. Indeed, while it cannot match the Jaguar’s speed, it sees better and anticipates the coming spells. Alas, the Eagle’s servants do not get spot in class (talk with your DM if interested in this), so his gifts are somewhat wasted. Once again, no spirits for the Eagle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horse: As you might imagine, the horse is a fast, hardy runner. However, it’s yet another gift few Barbarians have use for; your speed is already greater than that of your comrades, and further speed only breaks the group more. No, the Horse is truly right only for very few. On the bright side, it does not preclude the spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jaguar: The majority of Barbarians serve the Jaguar, without even knowing it. It’s a kind master, teaching speed and vigilance, and allowing for the service of the spirits. Indeed, because the option given to you as the “only” one is so pleasant, few even bother to consider the alternatives. The Jaguar allows for spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serpent: Much like the Bear, the Serpent learns to grapple, just a bit later. Unlike the Bear, the Serpent relies on stealth and speed while the Bear relies on endurance and strength in grapple to overcome his opponent. The two are interestingly similar, yet different paths. Like the Bear, the Serpent doesn’t have spiritual worshipers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wolf: Normally only intelligent Barbarians can learn such advanced combat tactics as tripping their opponents. The Wolf teaches you those secrets regardless of your mind; what even the smart take aeons (two feats) to master you learn with mere 1000 XP! Later, you learn to follow the tracks of your foes. Woe be you, you lose your sixth sense for enemies and traps, but the wolf warrior’s path makes it all worthwhile!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spiritual Totems [CC]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirit Bear: The Spirit Bear grants you the Improved Grab ability. Truly wonderful for those interested in Grappling while not interested in turning into actual Bears (why anyone wouldn’t want to be a bear, I have no idea).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Totem Manifestation allows you to rid yourself of the Damage Reduction for effective Improved Toughness [CW] – decent trade if a bit late.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirit Eagle: The Spirit Eagle gives you keen vision for your speed. Unfortunately, this does not grant you Spot nor Search in class (talk with your DM if interested in this), so you still won’t see a damn thing without DM intervention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Totem Manifestation is again similarly useless unless your DM allows you to actually learn to see.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirit Fox: The Fox makes you stealthy. The same problem as with other skill-related things, you’d need to learn to train stealth to truly make this worthwhile. Again, talk with your DM.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Totem Manifestation is actually quite decent; +1 Dodge each time you’d gain DR. For the non-Shocked Barbarians, this is quite an interesting path to pursue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirit Lion: The Spirit Lion gives you Pounce in exchange for extra movement. You can now full attack on a charge. You can even pick Whirling Frenzy to enjoy from level 1. Sold!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Totem Manifestation teaches you to roar. You get Strength-based fear-inducing Roar that apparently takes no action (once per day for each point of DR you’d have).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirit Wolf: The Spirit Wolf teaches you how to best utilize the distraction provided by your allies; you learn to better benefit of flanking your opponents. Handy for those who can rely on allies providing flank; makes for more Power Attack!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Totem Manifestation provides you with Track and some bonuses to Survival. Poor ability that curiously doesn’t improve as your DR would; if you plan on ending your Barbarian progression at level 7 (not that unlikely given that Barbarian PrCs start around this time), it may be worth considering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alternative Class Features&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;He is truly wise&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;who’s traveled far&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;and knows the ways of the world.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;He who has traveled&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can tell what spirit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;governs the men he meets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Hávámal, The Sayings Of Odin&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Got class features you don't like? Want to better tailor your Barbarian's abilities to your playstyle? Then you need Alternative Class Features!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ferocity [CS Web]: Rage boosts dexterity and strength instead. -2 penalty to ranged attack rolls outside 30 feet instead of penalty to AC. Sickened instead of fatigued. The kickass part is that you can get ferocious whenever the damn you please; it’s an immediate action to start!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whirling Frenzy [UA]: Rage increases Strength, Ref saves and AC. Allows an extra attack each turn (-2 penalty to all attacks made that turn, including AoOs). Lose Indomitable Will, gain Evasion when raging. Basically, hit things more! Hit things more often! Dodge what’s coming! The only drawback is that you give up your Rage protecting your mind, making you vulnerable to those damn Jedi mind tricks, and that while Whirling, you may not use other kinds of Rages. Alas, but for the straight-classed Barbarians who prefer not getting hit (and hitting others while at it), this is definitely the way to go. Oh, and this is just the thing for Barbarian Archers!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spell Sense [CM]: Trade Trapsense bonus for AC bonus vs. Spells. If you actually have a build with some AC (mayhap a Spirit Fox-worshipping Barbarian Tripper?), this is well worth it. Of course, the primary selling point is that you get rid of Trapsense!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trapkiller [DS]: Trade Trapsense for the ability to detect traps with Survival (!!) and to disarm them by bashing them to bits! Maybe you’re not quite as experienced as the Rogue (-5 to Survival-checks), but you’re damn good at disarming the mechanical ones (and you have the whatchacall’em spell dudettes to disarm the others; you can still find magical traps!).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streetfighter [CS Web]: Gets you rid of the stupid Damage Reduction that never did anyone any good, gives you all kinds of wonderful abilities while charging! TATSUMAKI SENPU KYAKU!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasteland Trap Sense [Sand]: Rids you of Trap Sense for more useless Trap Sense. Congratulations, bad just got worse!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bonus Feat [Sand]: Lose your Improved Uncanny Dodge, but acquire an Endurance-type feat. Great if one of those is a prerequisite for whatever class you’re looking at. Worthless otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wasteland Damage Reduction [Sand]: Loses Damage Reduction for a more useless form. Wasteland specializes in making bad worse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berserker Strength [PHBII]: Lose controlled Rage for uncontrolled Rage. That activates when you’re basically dead. Yea...no.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crafty Hunter [UA]: Lose Rage, gain Archery Combat Style and Favored Enemy. Seeing that what makes Barbarian a good Archer is a Rage-variant...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aquatic Barbarian [Storm]: Lose Fast Movement for improvement in Racial Swim Speed. If you have a racial swim speed, chances are you’re better off taking some of the other variants. Just a suggestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roofdweller [CS Web]: So you get two useless feats for Fast Movement. Let me think, no?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planar Barbarian [PlH]: Knowledge (the Planes) in class&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3rd level: Lose Trap Sense for something equally useless! Congratulations, yet another wasted trade.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th level: Lose Damage Reduction for a more useless form of Damage Reduction! Woot!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th level: Lose Greater Rage for...well, I don’t really care, if you came this far, you did it for Greater Rage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Duskling Barbarian [MoI]:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st level: You lose Fast Movement for speed increases through Incarnum. You have better uses for both, Fast Movement and Essentia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th level: Lose Damage Reduction, gain Damage Reduction you need to invest essential in. Where’s the vomit smiley when I need one?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th level: Gain extra Essentia while Raging. Actually almost worthwhile! The only problem is that by this point, lack of Essentia shouldn’t really be your primary concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fangshield Barbarian (non-Human) [CV]:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3rd level: Lose Trapsense and gain the ability to charge longer distances. Anything useful that replaces Trapsense is good in my book! That said, it competes with Trapkiller, Spell Sense and several totems, and it’s enhancement bonus, which sucks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th level: Lose your Improved Uncanny Dodge, gain the ability to use actually useful version of Awesome Blow – Awesome Charge! Basically, you get to knock people around at the end of a charge. Imagine it combined with Pounce; you can send a whole bunch of them flying in various directions!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th level: Lose the initial Damage Reduction, gain the ability to heal yourself for twice your HD in HP with Rage-uses. Sure, take away my worthless abilities and increase my versatility!\&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Half-Orc Barbarian [RoD]:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2nd level: Lose some stupid dodging abilities, learn to charge more heedlessly. The less AC, the better!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th level: Uh, you get bonuses on Will-saves vs. Illusions. For the uninitiated, Color Spray is ineffective already and to even get a Will-save vs. your average Illusion, you need to interact with it. And uhh...well, just no.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th level: Lose Damage Reduction, two-hand more effectively. Oh mi gosh, it’s useful! Definitely one of the better ways to get rid of DR, although I prefer Street Fighter myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Goliath Barbarian [RoS]: Knowledge (Nature) in class&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st level: Become Large when raging and get more Str! This is the #1 reason to play Goliath!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th level: Get Ex Light Fortifications. As you can never upgrade them, you’re better off just getting an armor with heavies instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th level: Get more of a worse kind of Damage Reduction. While slightly better than standard, it’s still too little to bother with; just get something useful instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Combinations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, a few tricks as to how to combine the different options to a devastating/useful effect. Notation (F) = Feat, (S) = skill trick, (A) = alternative class feature:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Power Attack (F) + Shock Trooper (F) + Spirit Lion Totem Pounce (A) + Leap Attack (F) + Knockback (F)/Awesome Charge (A)/Knock-Down (F) (+ Twisted Charge (S)/Street Fighter (A) + Nimble Charge (S)): Charge at 1+ opponents. Reduce 1+ opponents to smoldering remains lying within half a dozen feat from you on the ground. Add Cleaving Charge (A) to do it at multiple places in a turn!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intimidating Rage (F) + Imperious Command (F) + Immediate Rage (F)/Ferocity (A) + Never Outnumbered (S): Barbarian Celerity! Show your true face as an immediate action, making everyone within 30’ cower and bask in your glory!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combat Reflexes (F) + Martial Stance: Thicket of Blades (F) + Robilar’s Gambit (F) + Mage Slayer (F) + Stand Still (F)/Improved Trip (F): Make opponent do nothing! Whatever they do, they provoke and if they try to move, you can stop them and if they do anything else, you can hit them hard. Lockdown: Making life miserable for everyone but you since 2006!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track (F) + Trapkiller (A): Make your Survival do everything! Physical traps? Survival. Tracking? Survival. Wilderness movement? Survival. Food? Survival. Whatever else? Roll Survival just in case. It probably works.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weapon Finesse (F) + Shadowblade (F) + Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Spiked Chain (F) + Frantic Rage (F)/Ferocity (A) + Ape-Totem Barbarian (A): Whoever said Kobolds don’t make for good Barbarians? Suddenly you do everything based on Dex and get notable bonuses in the stat from your race and class while being able to dump Str!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mountain Rage (A) + Wolf Berserker (F) + Improved Trip (F): Hurl anything up to Huge size around like they were paper and hit them again for their troubles!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prestige Classes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;HEY!

You’ll win at running, sports, weddings, arson, irony, and other things YOU AREN’T EVEN SUPPOSED TO WIN AT!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;WAAAGH!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Core&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Horizon Walker [DMG]: When your options are limited, walking the planes is the best way to expand your abilities. That is the calling of a Horizon Walker; master the environment, master yourself, master the multiverse!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Prerequisites: One feat. Endurance. Useless, but it’s just one. Also, you need Knowledge (Geography), not Barbarian’s bread-and-butter, so you should consider spending a brief amount of time as a Ranger to enter in due time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, skills, the usual (although better skill list!). Smaller HD. The interesting stuff comes from the terrain masteries. Basic terrain masteries are dull; competence (available everywhere) bonuses to skills, small bonuses to attacks against creatures of certain type with Darkvision and Immunity to Fatigue being the more interesting ones. The truly interesting stuff comes from Planar Masteries, behold:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shifting Mastery: You can Dimension Door once per 1d4 rounds, with a caster level of your character level. For real. Yes, even outside shifting planes! This is truly why the class is worth taking; melee classes really enjoy the mobility this brings to allow you to choose the location where to go about your trip/kill routines!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aligned Mastery: You gain immunity to the adverse effects of being of the wrong alignment on a plane. Handy, not a reason to pick a class. But what’s this? You also gain immunity to aligned spells! This is basically the only means to truly protect yourself from Blasphemy and the like – truly increases your durability against the most fearsome attacks in the game!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cavernous Mastery: You gain Tremorsense 30’. Umm, yea. It’s good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cold/Fiery Mastery: 20 points of energy resistance to appropriate types? Yes, it’s nice to be practically immune to fire/cold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: If you’re restricted to only Core-classes, this is the only PrC worth thinking about. It’s pretty comparable to straight Barbarian, although you need to shift your focus from Raging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Completes, Races &amp;amp; PHBII&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear Warrior [CW]: So, you like Rage? Makes you feel good and gives you the high of power! Now, imagine if others could see how damn good you feel. Then Bear Warrior is for you – not only do you become freakishly strong, you’ll be a f*cking bear! That way everyone will know just how fucking awesome you are! This awesome deal bears a closer look:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: None! Wait, really? +7 BAB (level 8 entry then), Power Attack (yea, you DO have it), Rage or Frenzy (yes, you DO have it). That means you need absolutely nothing to enter. Nothing at all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian skills, saves, bla bla bla bla, nobody cares. The thing you’re looking for is this:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bear form: When raging, a bear warrior can turn into a motherfucking bear!&lt;br /&gt;The gist of it: you get fewer uses of Rage (cry me a river, pick Extra Rage) and in exchange, each use of your Rage allows you to RIP THINGS APART. Basically, you get the Rage-modifiers of a level 20 Barbarian on level 8. And you get 3 natural weapons. Character level 13, you become Large and get Improved Grab for good measure. Character level 17, you get +20 Str (and some Dex, Natural Armor and Con). For serial killers and great justice!&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is a catch (no, not the “once per day”-thing; errata removes the conflicting statement and you’re only limited by your Rage-uses). You can’t use standard weapons. You do get all your awesome Natural Weapons, but you don’t add 2x Power Attack to the damage. However, since you get 3 Natural Weapons, you’re fine for starters.&lt;br /&gt;Later? Pick Improved Unarmed Strike (or better, dip Fist of the Forests) and Multiattack. Do full iterative with your Unarmed Strike and all 3 Natural Weapons as secondaries, all adding full PA (not 2x though) to damage! Enter Shock Trooper and Leap Attack, turning you into a full fledged godless killing machine. So not only do you claw and bite the opponents, you also batter and crush them with your bearliness; the bear knows kung-fu!&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, all your natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered light weapons (and still add PA damage as per Power Attack-description in PHB), so you could use “Snow Tiger Berserker” Lodge-feat from Unapproachable East to gain Pounce, allowing you to retain your Fast Movement for the cost of a feat – worth thinking about! Oh, and then there’s the whole “Yes, you’re a Large creature with disgusting Str and Improved Grab” going on for you! Only you can grapple the Tarrasque and live to tell the tale!&lt;br /&gt;Remember to pester your DM about how equipment works with this. Polymorph (the ability this is paralleled to) states that “all equipment the new form could wear stay on you while others meld”, which would suggest that among others, you’d keep any Belts, Cloaks, Bracers, Boots and Amulets. Feel free to argue about armor, gloves and the like – that’s purely between your DM and you. Do know though that Dire Bear is only marginally stronger than Brown Bear; for the aspiring Bears, a strong consideration of whether those 5 levels are really worth it is in order.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Smokey! (That means “kickass” for those that do not speak Bear)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fist of the Forest [CC]: These “Barbarians” hail from wilderness, hence their name. The Fists of the Forest allow the wilderness to empower them, share its strength with them. Indeed, the Barbarians in the Fists’ ranks are truly the most formidable of their kind! As a bonus, the path is short and mighty – the Barbarians entering the ranks of the Fists need not wait for the fulfillment of their abilities; the nature provides instant gratification, as it should be!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How then does it work?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Two feats. Great Fortitude and Improved Unarmed Strike (don’t be tempted to be a Monk, for verily, they lose BAB and enter later). Oh, and the usual Power Attack. Then you need some skills you have in class, and BAB +4. And permission, but ‘cause you’re a Barbarian you practically have it already.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB and HD, skilled in dodging in addition to withstanding, only 2 skills/level. Only 3 levels long – lots of awesome in a short span! The interesting stuff:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast Movement: Yeah, you move even faster!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feral Trance: Get in touch with your primal self! Adds to Dex, unarmed damage and teaches you to bite (read: extra attack)! Can specifically be used while Raging!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AC bonus: The tougher you get, the harder it is to damage you! You get your CONSTITUTION to AC. Yes. For real. Sure, you can’t wear an armor, but who cares? It’s not like you much cared for armor anyways; it just gets in the way of your being awesome!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unarmed Strike Damage: Three levels give you the damage a Monk needs 8 levels for! Use your fists for everyday tasks like television, or romance, or helicopter repair and maintenance! You even get to hit through DR/Magic, incorporeality and all that with your BARE HANDS!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scent: Yes. For real!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All this in 3 levels for the low, low price of two feats and having to sleep out and hunt instead of pretending to be a city dweller (you’re a damn Barbarian, this is a given)! Oh yeah, and you can break these rules three times per month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Always! Only three levels and two feats for all kinds of awesome! I heard Fists of the Forests got along well with Bear Warriors. You may wish to try marrying the two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frenzied Berserker [CW]: Barbarians don’t feel true rage. A true rage enraptures all, encompasses all, endures all! To walk the path of true rage, you must step into the boots of a Frenzied Berserker. Your power will be overwhelming – over nine thousand, infact. The true strength though comes from your ability to channel your hatred; once you let your anger flow through you, your hate will make you strong, and once you do hit it will increase the impact tenfold! That is why you walk this perilous path; so you’ll hit harder than anyone!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Three feats. Cleave (serves you well to speed up gutting the sheep), Destructive Rage (waste of time; with your strength, you need no help in wrecking objects), Intimidating Rage (it helps when you make it work – needs Charisma, otherwise not your cup of tea). Power Attack is on the list too, but it’s basically a class feature. And BAB +6 and Barbarian alignment (again, these don’t count). So, you pay to enter alright.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB and saves. Only two points per level and crappy list. Sucks. Now on to the good stuff::&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diehard: Meh, but bonus feats are always handy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supreme Cleave: Makes your Cleave better. Why not?! You can take a 5’ step between your Cleave-attack and principal attack – a great way to make the feat more useful (and with the amount of damage you can dish out, it WILL be useful)!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved/Supreme Power Attack: Now we’re talking! Your principal source of damage…doubled? Yes, for real! First, you get 1.5x bonuses on Berserker level 5 (character level 11), you get the bonuses doubled. Note that errata clarifies it’s 50% and 100% instead of x1.5 and x2; therefore, you get full benefits with a two-handed weapon too!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frenzy: Ah, now this is what the class is all about! Your true hatred! One use per two levels – they’ll add up fast! Also, you can Frenzy while Raging for truly massive bonuses. But what does the Frenzy mean? To start with, you gain +6 Str and an extra attack each round (doesn’t stack with Haste; handy on those levels though!). The price is -4 AC (so you shouldn’t bother with it at all) and 2 points of non-lethal damage per round (mommy, you only have few hundred points of HP). The bigger thing though? You need to make DC20 Will-save to end this Frenzy. Why is that bad? Once the baddies run out, you’ll be attacking your allies (and no, you cannot Iron Heart Surge it away; you need to spend your actions attacking to best of your ability)!&lt;br /&gt;You’ll NEED to work around this. Have your casters prepare spells that stop you from wrecking allies. Get a Merciful weapon as your primary weapon of choice. Take Steadfast Determination. Get thrown into an Oytugh Hole. Just make sure your failed Will-save doesn’t end up with a very dead party and a very, very “Do not want!” Berserker. A thing adding to the problem – if you’re dealt damage, you need to succeed a Will-save against 10+damage dealt or start Frenzy. That makes traps, environment and similar hitting you doubly dangerous! Of course, all this isn’t worth +6 damage and an extra attack. However, there is more still.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deathless Frenzy: Berserker level 4, you become immortal! For real. That means if you get knocked for 20000 points of damage, you’ll remain standing…for as long as you Frenzy. Once it runs, you’ll die if you’re not in positives. Still, being immortal is pretty fucking awesome. At least, if you die, that Dragon comes down with you! Since your Frenzy lasts for 3+Con rounds and you can Rage before it for extra Con, you can make it last long enough. This is just awesome!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater Frenzy: +10 Str, no frills. You don’t need me to tell you this is awesome. Level 8.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inspire Frenzy: The last in the long list of controversial class features; you can make your allies Frenzy! If they’re near you, you can give them Frenzy for 3+Con (YOUR Con) rounds. All allies within 10’. That means if you’re in a tough fight in an AMF with an otherwise caster-party, everyone will suddenly learn to kick ass and chew bubblegum! Now, this means all the normal drawbacks too. So if you run out of opponents before Frenzy runs out (likely), you’ll have a bunch of DC 20 Will-saves or a vast free-for-all melee; beware!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Gambler’s choice; huge risks, huge rewards for those that find ways to subsume the risks! Just beware; in the end, the house always wins. And your house is the DM!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rage Mage [CW]: Ever been really annoyed by something and just hoped the something would be vaporized? This class tries to make those wishes come true. As an angry magician, you maintain a Barbarian’s abilities while learning to hurl spells empowered by your rage at hapless Gnomes. At least that’s the general idea; how it works in practice deserves a closer look:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: One feat in Combat Casting, 2nd-level Arcane Spells, +4 BAB, Rage, Nonlawful alignment. The combination of 2nd-level spells and +4 BAB is a tad difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Medium BAB, inexistent skills, good Fort-saves. Who the hell decided this thing has medium BAB? Anyways, onto the real business:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spell rage: Well, this is obviously what this class is all about. Which is why you’ll be sad to find out that you need to wait 5 levels to be able to use this twice per turn. And 9 for three uses. Basically, you take additional AC penalty, but can cast spells in Rage. Even better, you cast all Evocation, Transmutation, Conjuration, Abjuration and Necromancy-spells on your character level, so your actual caster level hardly matters.&lt;br /&gt;Or that’s the idea anyways; being limited to doing this once per day sucks a metric crapton as your abilities outside this spell rage are going to suffer from the classes you’re taking. Since this is a “Rage”, you should be able to Extra Rage it though which fixes the major issue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overcome Spell Failure: So yea, you can wear a light armor again. Yay?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spells per day: Now, this just sucks. This supposed fighter/mage class gets spells only every other level. Which is about as effective as alternating between Fighter- and Wizard-levels (or to say, not very; they specifically printed Eldritch Knight to help with that).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rage: Extra uses of Rage. Sure, why not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spell Fury: Having to wait until level 7 to get the first real class feature just sucks. Luckily, this is a good one; free quickening on a spell of level 4 or lower. Really helps with your action economy especially since your casting is like to be a bit lacking. Only once per spellrage though so it alone isn’t enough; you still need something to quicken a spell for the remaining rounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tireless Rage: When will your Rage ever run out during an encounter? Yea, this won’t come up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warrior Cry: You can gain enhancement bonuses to all physicals (which you already have) and full BAB (which you’d have if you weren’t fooling around with this class) once per day as a free action? Woohoo, what a capstone! Basically, this allows you to pretend once per day that you didn’t take Rage Mage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Sucks! Now, to be fair, it is possible to build a decent character with Rage Mage. It takes a lot of work and it’s still not amazing, but Spell Fury is the saving grace preventing the class from falling into the “no unique class features”-pit. That said, unless you know you want this specific class and have a very good idea of what you’re doing, stay away and leave this to the professionals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Racial Specials&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eye of Gruumsh [CW]: Orcs are the most populous Barbarians on the planet. That much is known. Therefore, it's no surprise that Orcish Barbarians have their own sects with their own abilities. This is the organization for Orcish barbarians. But do they truly live up to their name of greatest Barbarians in the world? Let's find out!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Two feats, Proficiency and Focus in Orc Double Axe. If your DM isn't a total doofus, he'll give Orcs automatic proficiency anyways, reducing it to one feat (which still sucks). Other than that, you got to be an Orc (duh) or a Half-Orc (don't...just don't). Then you have to get rid of one of your eyes. WTF, right? Apparently it's no problem though. Gotta be Gruumsh Cleric Alignment though; CN, CE, NE. Bad for adventuring, although CN might be doable. +6 BAB.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, less skills. Usual fare, a small step down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blind-Fight: So yea, a crappy bonus feat. Congrats! One step closer to Pierce Magical Concealment for surprising those pesky mages though. Also, you can act as if you had both eyes. So much for that ritual, eh?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Command the Horde: You can command a bunch of weaker Orcs 30' from you. God help any opposing Orcish force encountering you!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rage: So your Eye of Gruumsh-levels stack with Barbarian for extra Rages. Booooring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swing Blindly: Now, this is something! More strength, more AC penalty, on level 2! What it basically comes down to is that you hit harder and get hit more! Just the way you like it, especially since everyone automatically hits you anyways!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ritual Scarring: You get some Natural Armor on 3, 6 &amp;amp; 9 to make up for the lost AC above. In reality, nothing happens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blinding Spittle: What a corny attack! You spit your stomach acid up to 20' away at a creature's eyes. The best part? Your stomach acid is mighty potent! 10+Eye of Gruumsh-level+Con! Smaller DCs have thrown men into despair. Also, it isn't listed to take an action; I suppose that defaults to a standard action, but man, would it be awesome to get it as a free action? Either way, while very limited in times/day, this is an actually useful ability! You start with 2 on level 4 and get it to max of 4 times on level 7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blindsight: You sense things 5' from you starting from level 5. On level 8, you sense things almost next to you (10'!). Never really big enough to help, but allows you to smack that sneaky thief who forgot to buy Lords of Madness for his idiocy (or should I say, his madness?).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sight of Gruumsh: So basically, you get more power from...seeing when you die! That's right, Orcs wanna die! This gives you morale bonuses to saves and AC. Rather trivial as you're still tanking your AC with your Rage, but hey, whatever right? That said, this is not worth taking all 10 levels for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Orcs...could do better. That said, increasing your Strength-bonus when Raging is very good and while the prerequisites are completely pointless (seriously, Orc Double Axe?! What do you expect Barbarians to do, play Darth Maul?), Blinding Spittle is another handy ability. All in all, starts off crappy but turns out actually semi-decent! Probably loses out to straight Barbarian, but not by all that much (and that's mostly because this class gets some pointless AC boosts while tanking its AC further when Raging), mostly on the pointless prerequisites (ask your DM to homebrew a two-handed exotic Orc War Axe with 2d8 damage or something and call it a day).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orc Warlord [RoF]: Alright, so let's say you want to build a horde and go ravage the world. This is the prestige class for you! The Orc Warlord is a 5 level long prestige class focused on increasing the amount of lackeys you can get with the Leadership feat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Orc or half orc BAB of&amp;nbsp;+5 or higher. Any non-good alignment. Intimidate 8 ranks, Ride 5 ranks, Survival 5 ranks. Leadership and the feats Blood of the Warlord or Might Makes Right. Finally, the rage ability – but of course you have that if you're reading this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Full BAB, good Fortitude and Will saves, some skills, 2+Int mod skill points per level, yadda yadda. You're not here for that, though the higher Will save is nice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gather Horde: You can attract 150% the number of followers you would otherwise be able to as a 1st level Orc Warlord. At 3rd, you get 200% more followers! These extra followers must be orcs. And given how Might Makes Right lets you add your Strength bonus to your Leadership score, you will have a lot of followers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inspire Courage: The surest way to stop your troops from running away from scary things in front of them is to put something even scarier behind them. By speaking (or howling, ranting, etc) for one full round, you can Inspire Courage in your minions. This works similar to the bard's ability (but does not stack with it) with a few differences: you grant a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls, and you can use it while raging! Intriguingly, there are no limits on how many times you may initiate it. The warlord can't cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word, but what self-respecting orc would do that sort of thing anyways?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Final Rage: The 5th level capstone is the ability to incite rage in yourself and your allies as a free action, even those that have run out of rages or could not otherwise rage. Anyone already in a rage gets upgraded to a greater rage. The rage lasts until the end of the warlord's next turn, and then everyone suffers penalties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Leadership shenanigans are always fun. The follower boosting runs out at level 3, though, the Inspire Courage doesn't scale, level 4 is a dead level, and the capstone Final Rage is too brief to do the concept of a howling mad orc horde justice. If you're in a game where you could make use of a large number of followers, you might consider 3 levels in this at most.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Battlerager [RoF]: These are also called the &quot;Kuldjargh&quot; or &quot;Axe idiots&quot;, and for a reason. If you remember Thibbledorf Pwent from Salvatore's books...well, this is nothing like him. Still, seeing that Dwarves do have a history for raging, so let's see what their racial &quot;angry class&quot; does:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Two feats, Cleave &amp;amp; Endurance. Not bad, Cleave is handy on its own and Endurance leads to Steadfast Determination. Skills though, you need 8 ranks in Intimidate (ok), 2 ranks in Knowledge: Religion (WTF?) and two ranks in two Performs, including Perform: Singing (WTF?!). Oh, and a non-lawful Dwarf and the ability to rage, but duh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: They get the already-familiar Barbarian BAB, saves, etc. and less skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rage: They get an extra use of Rage on first and every two levels thereafter. This is actually good since it's much faster than standard Barbarian progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gruff: -4 to all Charisma-based skills and Charisma-checks, except Intimidate to which you get +2 on level 1. If you're making a non-Intimidate Charisma check as a Dwarf Barbarian, something is wrong. This is ok, although due to their racial Charisma-penalty, Dwarves make for some of the worst Intimidator Barbarians in the first place.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rock Gut: +2 to saves vs. poison. So...you still fail only on 1. Nothing new here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close-Quarter Fighting: On level 2, you can avoid Grapples. The thing is, with your Str and abilities, nothing short of the Tarrasque will be grappling you anyways. At least you get to pretend you're getting class features.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fearless: On level 2, you become immune to fear-effects, +2 Insight to all saves vs. mind-affecting. Useful to a degree! Insight is an obscure bonus-type to saves too!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Unarmed Strike: Yawn. This is only a prerequisite. Level 3, btw. I suppose it helps enter some other classes, but it's not worth hammering your head to a wall for 3 levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Great Cleave: Yawn. Sometimes randomly useful. If only you were naturally Large, not some pesky Dwarf... Level 4 too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reckless Offensive: Yawn. I guess it's a free bonus. This is the same feat as the &quot;Reckless Offense&quot;-feat in SRD, except with a bit higher prerequisites. Likewise, level 4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Natural Armor: +2 hardly makes up for all the penalties you'll be taking. Whatever... And this is all you get on level 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Dwarves could do a lot better. Basically, you get +2 Intimidate, immunity to Fear (available as a feat) and a bunch of worthless or random feats. In fact, this class is little more than a CW Samurai in disguise; you get a bunch of poor, pre-determined feats and that's about it. This is basically a test to see if giving a ton of sitiuational/weak/worthless feats in few levels somehow made said feats less worthless. Protip: It doesn't. Stay away. Oh yeah, and it's 3.0.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deepwarden [RoS]: Want to be a really hard guy? Like, Stonecold? If so, this is for you. Be the man...or dwarf of stone! Everything Battlerager should've been is right here. Toughness, simple kickass toughness and the feel of a Dwarf. A look at dwarfdom:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Endurance as the only feat - reasonable, especially with Steadfast Determination. Heal, Climb, Jump, Knowledge (Dungeoneering) &amp;amp; Survival 5 ranks. Heal and Knowledge cause trouble here; Barbarian has neither in class pushing entry to level 7 unless doing something about it – a 1-level dip in Ranger will do. 3 levels might be better for free Endurance though. BAB +5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB &amp;amp; Fort, good Will and 6+Int skills with a great list. Far superior to a Barbarian here.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track: Free bonus, why not? Adds to your Survival-based abilities; combine with Trapkiller for real Survival-focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trap Sense: Yawn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stone Warden: This is the reason to take Deepwarden. You get Con to AC over Dex! It's been clarified in FAQ that this is capped by armor's maximum bonus (RAW disagrees). However, there's an incredibly simple way around that: be unarmored! Pick up levels in Fist of the Forests to get Con to AC again! Since this replaces Dex, the two should stack just fine. Heck, pick a Monk's Belt for Wis to AC to boot! Then just enter classes that raise your Con skyhigh and enjoy your Way Higher Than Yours AC. The fact that this is available on level 2 makes this class best as a two-level dip (along with the good Will-saves). That said, the rest isn't horrible either; read on!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Animal Messenger: Free spell-likes never hurt. Good for delivering messages and so on. Small benefit though, and only thing you get on level 3.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uncanny Dodge: Well, since you traded the original for something more useful, here's your chance to pick it up again! Two levels for this is a bit much, but hey, you're getting a ton of skills, important good saves and all that so it's not all that bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stubborn Mind: With your Will, this extra insurance against domination could actually be useful! That said, you shouldn't plan on getting dominated often enough to make this good. Level 5 is still reasonable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sending: Actually a decent spell for communication and all that. No combat use, obviously, but it has obvious utility. Again, only class feature for level 6.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swift Tracker: Well, I suppose you might as well... Helps with your speed since Dwarves aren't naturally too fast trackers. Level 7 is really high though, seeing how little the class gives at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Uncanny Dodge: You still stick it to Rogues, except worse since this only counts your Deepwarden class level. If you got it as a Barb though, this is all good. As a painful note, this is level 8...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greater Animal Messenger: Meh, at this point the benefits really aren't matching up to the cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: This does it right. You get the huge defensive boost on level 2 and can afford some levels around that point. Two-level dip is great and you can afford up to 7 levels for the skills. It gets really hairy as the gains keep getting worse by the level. Still, the two-level dip is an obvious choice for most Dwarf Barbarians, especially in combination with Fist of the Forests to make the ability actually useful, and more Rage-versions that increase Con. Then you have Con to HP, Fort, Will (Steadfast) and AC twice. And thanks to Rage, your attacks will be very ok too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Other Sources&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frostrager [Frost]: In this universe, there's only one absolute... everything freezes! This class is for those who want to have cold, living hands. You have a soul of ice and you die to pour it on others! A mere Barbarian is hardy, but you are the winter itself, the icy, biting chill and the unstoppable advance! A closer look at the specifics of this frozen path of ruin:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Prerequisites: Two feats. Oh, and Power Attack. But you know the drill by now. Frozen Berserker is a mediocre feat and Improved Unarmed Strike is Improved Unarmed Strike. Oh, and you need some Intimidate, Survival and you need to almost die of cold. So nothing major. BAB +7&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, a bit fewer skills from an anemic list. Now, the things that make you a Frostrager...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frostrage: You become a chunk of ice when Raging! More specifically, you get a natural armor, you hit harder and and your hands deal cold damage. If you already have a bigger unarmed damage die, this should probably advance that. Check with your worldmaking slave to be sure. This is what the class is all about anyways. Do realize that cold resistance is only second to fire in commonness though so don't rely too much on the cold damage. It goes two ways though: just walk around in Energy Immunity: Fire and you've got resistance/immunity to the two most common energy types in the game!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Freezing Blood: So your blood is so cold it freezes if you were to bleed. Nothing major, but doesn't hurt one bit. All bonus! Apparently, you can manage with a bit slower blood circulation; I suppose your Rage evens the blood pressure out! Free level 1 bonuses never hurt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One-Two Punch: An extra attack. What's not to like? Oh yeah, the -2 penalty. But the thing is, since you're a Barbarian, you actually have the attack bonus to hit regardless. Great! And low level too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Absorb Cold: So you can have the Big Stupid Blaster target you and the enemy horde hopelessly hacking away at you with a cold-substituted generic Boom. Also, cold planes rock, 'cause apparently you absorb the lack of heat or something and heal. Whatever, I'll take what I'm given! You'll get it in the passing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Frostrage: So your fists keep growing! Congratulations. Now, if this stacks with Fist of the Forests, you'll actually be looking at 2d8 fists! Oh, and the cold damage you deal increases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rend: If you hit a dude twice, you get a third one for free! Nothing major, but no reason to turn down free damage! Of course, it's all you get on the last level so think carefully if you really want it all that much; it doesn't get PA bonus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: For the really, really cool dudes! Not best evar, but definitely not a waste of space either. As a northener myself, I approve.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runescarred Berserker [UE]: The best way to defeat Magic is through Magic, or, failing that, through negating Magic. If this is the path you choose, Runescarred Berserker is for you. You grow as a Barbarian, but learn to weave Magic through your Rage! In a world without magic the Barbarians rule supreme – the Runescarred make that world! This truly demands a closer look:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Three feats. Iron Will (handy), Survivor (sucks), Berserker Lodge Feat (includes quite a few good options, covered in the feat section). Also, a bunch of pointless skills and Intimidate, but you can afford them. BAB +7 and hail from Rashemen. Rough, but it gets better!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, skills, you know this crap. Additionally, this progresses most your Barbarian class features, granting you Damage Reduction, Extra Rage, Greater Rage. You also get Energy Resistance 5: Frost and some Natural Armor. Again, this is not what the class is about though. No, a Runescarred Berserker is defined by his runescars!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runescar: You can scribe a runescar on your body. You get a spell list to go with it, including such doozies as Heal, Air Walk, Anti-Magic Field, Restoration, Spell Immunity, True Strike, basic buffs and so on! You pick one to learn each level, then scribe a runescar on your body (costs a bit and deals damage that you can just heal afterwards) and then you can use it like a Potion! So, what makes this so awesome? Why, Anti-Magic Field of course! As said before, nothing beats a Barbarian without Magic and the ability to cast Anti-Magic Field gives YOU the tools to strip your opponents of their magical abilities. Have extraordinary means of flight and you’ll truly be the one-man wrecking crew – the bane of the fools relying on magic and their supernatural abilities! Of course, you’ll have to reach them first, but that can be arranged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: YES! THIS is how a Barbarian plays into his strengths! Slay the Wizard, save the world!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black Blood Cultist [CoR]: Do you want natural weapons, but still be a humanoid? Do you want to grapple people to death and then savage their souls? Do you want to truly be an incomparable wrestler? If so, this is for you. Don't be mislead by the name; all this PrC does is give you superb grappling abilities!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Two feats, Improved Unarmed Strike and Track. 8 ranks in Survival, 2 in Knowledge (Nature), Rage and Chaotic Neutral, Chaotic Evil or Neutral Evil alignment. Not too bad; those are easily attainable as bonus feats anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian skills, good Fort &amp;amp; Ref, but only medium BAB. You'll have to find other Grapple-bonuses for that. That said, the class features help out a lot:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feral Rage (Claws): You stack these levels for Rage-uses. All good. On level 1, you also get Claw-attacks. 1d6 damage, no less. Really nice; two primary Natural Weapons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damage Reduction: On level 1, it's 1/Silver. Pretty useless, but it may come up. On level 4 it's 3/silver and level 9 5/silver. The last one is almost never worth it due to the lost point of BAB, but the 3/silver is pretty much free and can be useful against Natural Attack- or Archery-focused characters. Pretty weak, but can randomally help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Grapple: Free bonus feat. All fine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feral Rage (Bite): A third natural attack. It's secondary, but it's still an extra attack so it's all good.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scent: Sure, why not. It can help you in a surprising number of circumstances and it's a free part of the progression on 4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stranglehold: Move Action Coup de Grace; handy for when you're in a hurry or have stunned guys that need a-killin'. Even better if you have Boots of Battle Charger allowing you to use the standard action for a pouncing Charge. Not that useful that often, but it can definitely have its moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feral Rage (Rend): More Natural Attack-damage never hurt anyone, except the opponent. Good for the level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improved Natural Attacks: See above. May stack with the Improved Natural Attack-feat as this isn't defined as a size increase and has a different name and mechanic (applies to all attacks).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Savage Grapple: This is why you take the class. Suddenly, your successful Grapple-checks downright destroy anything you're fighting, allowing you to easily drop anything in one round (Pouncing charge with Grab &amp;amp; Damage-attempts for iteratives should drop just about anything you can Grapple in the first place).&lt;br /&gt;This is also level 8, which means you still haven't lost the third point of BAB. You aren't going to either, so this is probably where you should bail out. Do note that Freedom of Movement is going to be ruining your day on these levels a lot, but that's just more of a reason to Anti-Magic it up. Few creatures want to be in Grapple with you, and those are Colossal so you can't Grab them anyways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feral Form: You need a really good reason to fight without Rage on these levels. This just shouldn't come up nearly often enough to matter. It costs you two levels and an extra point of BAB; the cost is simply too high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Fun with tentacles! It's obvious what Black Blood Cultist does: Grapple. And oh boy, does it ever Grapple well! Savage Grapple is the single most brutal attack you can do in Grapple and will result in really quick death whatever you're grappling. You'll need some manner of Anti-Magic to negate opponents' Freedom of Movement, and some manner of size increases to engage Larger-Than-Huge creatures, but if you want a grappler, you're unlike to do better than this at least as far as damage goes. Do note that Black Blood Cultist improves your damage, but is rather poor as far as your Grapple-checks go so couple it with something to help on that front (of course, as you're a Barbarian, you'll still do.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Primeval [Frost]: Barbarian ways date back to the dawn of time. Sometimes, a Barbarian may feel the need to dial back into day 1. That Barbarian is walking the path of a Primeval. Their strength as vast as the time before them, a Primeval is truly something to be feared. However, becoming one is not easy. Indeed, a great cost is required for a great gain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Three worthless feats: Self-Sufficient, Toughness, Endurance. Further, two worthless skills in Knowledge (Nature) and Handle Animal, only accompanied by Survival. Mere 5 ranks though. Finally, BAB +8; level 9 is the earliest possible entry. It is not easy being a Primeval, but the Bear Totem gets you Toughness, while Ranger levels net you Endurance, which means if you are smart, you only have to waste one feat on Self-Sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian BAB and saves, less skills - the usual story. To business:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Primeval Form: This is what the class is all about; an alternative, prehistoric form you can assume like the Bear Warrior assumes that of a Bear. This is mono-form, and thus you must choose a single form and ride it to the end. Remember that instead of gaining the form's ability scores, the form's modifiers are applied as a bonus to your stats. There could be no better news for a Barbarian! Your massive Strength and Con grow ever more massive. This is truly something amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Allow me to suggest anything with a large array of natural attacks. Giant Octopus, for example, makes for a fine choice. The more, the merrier! All your abilities are amplified by the number of natural attacks you have. Extra uses come on levels 4, 7 and 10 and are badly needed. It is worth inquiring if the &quot;Extra Wildshape&quot;-feat would give you extra uses of Primeval Form; Wildshape is listed as being able to mimic Primeval Form, but you lack Wildshape so you don't qualify for the feat without help from above.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Animal Empathy: You gain some trivial bonuses when meddling with animals of the type you change into. I know not of you, but it does sound horribly boring to me. Free extra ability never hurt anyone though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regression: You begin the return to your roots, losing intellect and force of will, while empowering your body. Indeed, you become more and more animal-like, the further you walk this path. Worry not, that's why you're here. Levels 2, 5 and 8 each see a change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-Light Vision: Having the ability in any form is always useful, when it comes as a bonus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feral Power: Now we are talking! Your physique reaches a new level, and you gain global bonuses to physical stats and armor. And the change continues! You accumulate these bonuses three times, making you vastly more powerful than standard version of your alter ego creature!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scent: Like anything feral, your auxiliary senses grow keener and you notice things before unsmelled. This is half-way through your regression, on level 5.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast Movement: As your physique develops, so does your speed. Once you reach 8th level, you gain a boost to movement. It's always good to have.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Primeval Shapeshifter: Alas, your last ability is not amazing. You become one with your animal spirit. Unfortunately, that means giving up the powers making it worthwhile to be a Humanoid in the first place; magic such as Enlarge Person can no longer be cast upon you. You also gain a worthless Damage Reduction as it's pierced by magic - every creature either has ability to pierce it with their natural weapons, or access to magical weapons. Either way, this is not worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Great power, great price! You pay a dear price to enter and the hour is late. However, the abilities you gain are quite wonderful. Your strength grows immensely and you can acquire a form of larger size, power and more attacks. The only turkey about this class is the 10th level. The costs are a bit high, but for those willing to pay, you'll feel strength you haven't experienced in millennia! If only Primeval weren't completely magical in nature...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totem Rager [MoI]: The primal ways of a Barbarian go hand-in-hand with the natural soul energy wielded by the Totemist. Where these two meet, a Totem Rager is born; the primal might of a Barbarian combined with the magical soulmelding of Totemist makes for some of the greatest warrior to ever have graced the planet with their presence. This is suited for those who have mastered manipulation of Incarnum. For those still learning, I suggest you start your studies here. With that said, let us see the deal here:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: One feat, Cobalt Rage. 5 ranks in Intimidate, 9 in Survival. The ability to bind soulmelds to Totem-chakra, Rage. Everything you would have anyways, so nothing of relevance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Medium BAB, d10 HD, Good Ref &amp;amp; Fort, Barbarian skills. A Barbarian he isn’t.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meldshaping: 8 levels out of 10 advance your meldshaping abilities. As the first level is void, it is in your best interest to take as many as you can. A very fair deal in its entirety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totem Rage: When raging, gain extra essential equal to half your Totem Rager level. Free bonuses, what’s not to love?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wild Empathy: Free bonuses never hurt anyone. Minor thing, but no need to complain, it’s still free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extra Rage: 2nd level grants you an extra use of rage. As a Barbarian, you surely can appreciate the value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damage Reduction: This is just as worthless as it is for a Barbarian as it comes in no greater quantities. Mayhap ask for one of Barbarian’s replacement options instead. That said, this is not why you’re taking the class so free bonuses again never hurt anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chakra Binds: It’s necessary to your advancement as a meldshaper to acquire the remaining chakras. Thankfully you get them in reasonable schedule, on 4th and 9th level respectively..&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extended Rage: Your Cobalt Rage now also extends the duration of your Rage. Not worth much, but at least you can be certain you can withstand the entire battle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Totem Chakra Bind: These improvements are necessary for you as a Totemist. Thankfully this is included in the class progression. As a capstone though, this is far away. Still, it’s very much worthwhile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Depends. The value of the class is entirely dependant on what you do with your Meldshaping. With all the natural weapons and strength-check/damage bonuses it provides, there are many ways to make for truly brutal Totem Ragers. But again, all that depends on your proficiency with Incarnum; the Rage-abilities are merely an afterthought. This is principally a class for Totemists who want some strength and the free Pounce.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Champion of Gwynharwyf [BoED]: Just walking the road of a Barbarian does not mean abandoning your deities. On the contrary, the life of strife can bring you closer to your deity than a life of service ever could. Champions are Barbarians elevated by their deities to be their champions and fight in the forefront of the battle of deities manifesting itself on the material world once again. Such is certainly worth something. Let us scan the costs:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prerequisites: Two feats; Knight of Stars and Righteous Wrath. 9 ranks in Intimidate, and BAB +6. Hefty entry price, but mayhap there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Chaotic Good alignment is likewise required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class features: Barbarian saves, skills, HD, BAB and everything else. This is all too familiar for us already. To the more unique part:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detect Evil: Like a Paladin, you can detect the presence of evil creatures. This will help you in your struggle for a better world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rage: You continue to advance as if a Barbarian. Most excellent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smite Evil: Like a Paladin, you learn to imbue a strike per day with divine energy dealing grievous wounds to the wicked. You gain only few uses overall, maxing out at 3 on level 9. As this is Charisma-based, you’re unlike to make much use of it anyways, although the extra damage is always worthwhile. Nevertheless, this is a minor ability and should be treated as such.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spells: Now this is a reason to choose the path of a divine champion; you learn to cast a small number of divine spells to better thwart the evil Wizards’ magic and to hit them in the head even harder! This is Wisdom-based, which is definitely doable as Wisdom is already useful anyways and you only need 14 for your highest level magic. Their magic protects and enhances their combat ability, so you must still do the attacking, but your god can empower your strikes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Furious Casting: This is what the class is all about; in spite of the Rage, you can use magic! Truly wonderful ability, and granted on level two.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Divine Grace: Like a Paladin, you can use your Force of Will to protect you from harmful magic. Unless you use the Battle Blessing [CC] feat to cast based on Charisma though, you’re unlike to have enough for relevant bonuses. As a bonus though, Charisma-focused Champion makes for a mighty intimidator too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Damage Reduction: Over the span of 10 levels, you get 5/- DR. This is actually a bit better than the standard Barbarian-ability and can be sometimes helpful due to the relatively fast progression. Don’t rely on this to keep you alive though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resist Enhancement: Further defenses for your mind; it never hurts to be more secure against enhancements. This is on character level 9 too so you get it way before it becomes trivial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fearsome Fury: This adds perfectly to the Intimidate-combo! You get an effective extra Intimidate vs. everyone! Imperious Command it up and you have a bunch of opponents most definitely cowering in your feet! Truly an ability worth taking the class for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Energy Resistance: So yes, you get a resistance to an energy type on 5 and it improves on 10. Free bonuses never hurt anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immune to Charm and Compulsion: Free immunities never hurt anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Verdict: Yes! For a charismatic Barbarian, or one interested in spellcasting, this is a wonderful class. Nobody else would even be interested, so in short, this rocks! Although more than 8 levels is probably a waste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Possessions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weapons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery. You must learn its riddle. You must learn its discipline. For no one - no one in this world can you trust. Not men, not women, not beasts. Only the sword is worthy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Anon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Types:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Greatsword: It's a great sword.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guisarme: A reach weapon which allows for tripping. Good basic weapon choice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spiked Chain: Possibly the best exotic weapon for a barbarian, since it allows you to attack everyone in a 10 foot radius and can be used for tripping.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locked Gauntlet: Gives a +10 bonus to resist being disarmed, and can be used to bitch slap the pansy who tried to disarm you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spiked Gauntlet: Deals slightly more damage than a locked gauntlet. Fortunately, you can wear one of each type.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Armor Spikes: Show that monk who's boss in a grapple!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Composite Longbow: Shooting people in the face is a path full of awesome and win.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Materials:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Adamatine: Great for weapons since it allows you to overcome DR and break things.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Enchantments:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collision (MiC, +2 Bonus): Adds 5 extra points of damage per hit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eager (MiC, +1 Bonus): +2 to initiative when wielding, can be drawn as a free action. +2 damage on surprise and first round of combat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ghost Touch (PHB, +1 Bonus): Hitting ghosts is a good thing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magebane (CArc, +1 Bonus): +2 extra enhancement and +2d6 damage against Batman and anyone else who casts arcane spells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Merciful (PHB, +1 Bonus): Good to have if you're a Frenzied Berserker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spell Storing (PHB, +1 Bonus): Delivering a spell via hitting someone in the face is fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transmuting (MiC, +2 bonus): After one hit, the weapon will automatically bypass the DR of the target. Less useful if you deal so much damage that anyone who does not have DR high in the triple digits will be dead instantly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Valorous (UE, +1 Bonus): Doubles damage dealt on a charge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warning: (MiC, +1 Bonus): +5 to initiative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wounding (PHB, +2 Bonus): Deals 1 Con damage per hit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wrathful Healing (E&amp;amp;A, +3 Bonus): Heal half the damage you deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Note: There are many weapon crystals in the MiC that give or emulate some of the enchantments above. These are generally awesome and worth your while.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Specific weapons:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Halberd of Vaulting: A 3.0e weapon from the Arms and Equipment Guide that has a +2 enhancement bonus, doubles damage on a charge when dropping from a certain height, and gives +30 to jump checks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Luck Blade (PHB, 22,060 gp): Keep an empty one around for the +1 luck bonus to saves and the reroll ability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Armors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look to your battle-gear and it will protect you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;We guard it with our lives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Your armour is your Soul, and your Soul’s dedication its armour&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The soul of a warrior is the shield of humanity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Honour the craft of death&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Only the Emperor is higher in our devotion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Honour the battle-gear of the Dead&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;We ask only to serve&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Warrior's Catechism of Worship&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Types:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Studded Leather: It's cheap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chain Shirt: Best light armor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breastplate: Best medium armor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Full Plate: Best heavy armor. If you did not trade your movement bonus for Pounce, make it mithral.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Materials:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mithral armor means you can treat heavy armor as medium. This is great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enchantments:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Animated (PHB, +2 Bonus): Have a shield without having to carry a shield!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Displacement (MiC, +1 Bonus): Once per day, gain the effects of the Displacement spell for 5 rounds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light/Medium/Heavy Fortification (PHB, +1/+3/+5 Bonus): Negating sneak attack and critical hits is useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soulfire (BoED 112, +4 Bonus): Immune to death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and any negative energy effects.&amp;nbsp; Seeing as you probably will be getting hit by all sorts of nasty creatures with your low AC, this is totally worth it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: There are many armor crystals in the MiC that give or emulate some of the enchantments above. These are generally awesome and worth your while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Specific Armors:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Rhino Hide (PHB, 5,165 gp): +2 armor that has an ACP of -1 and adds +2d6 to damage on a charge, even if it is a mounted charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Items&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;And besides...the little girl will be missing her doll. We should return it to her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Shan Yu&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;11 foot pole: For those situations in which a 10 foot pole just won’t cut it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Armbands of Might (CAdv, 4100 gp): Get +2 to damage if Power Attacking for a -2 or greater penalty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Belt of Battle (MiC, 12,000 gp): More actions? Yes please!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steadfast Boots (MiC, 1400 gp): Provides a +4 bonus against bull rush, trip, or overrun attacks. Also, two handed weapons that you wield are automatically treated as being readied against chargers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boots of Speed (PHB, 12,000 gp): Haste yourself for fun and profit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brawndo the Thirst Mutilator: It’s like a monster truck you can pour into your face. Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to crush a human skill with your fists? Well, wonder no longer, because Brawndo TASTES how that would FEEL! Made with 100% concentrated RAGE!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloak of Displacement, Minor (PHB, 24,000 gp): Your armor class sucks. Might as well go for miss chances.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloak of Weaponry (MiC, 2,300 gp): This item stores 25 pounds worth of nonliving material if it can fit under the cloak. Will not rupture if sharp objects are placed within.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figurine of Wondrous Power: Bronze Griffon (PHB, 10,000 gp): A flying mount is always useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gloves of the Titan's Grip (MiC, 7,000 gp): Provides a +8 enhancement bonus to grapple. I bet monks wish they had room for these between their Gloves of Dexterity and magical ki wraps!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gem of True Seeing (PHB, 75,000 gp): True Seeing is useful. Unfortunately, you have to hold onto it, which prevents you from using a two handed weapon. If only there were some way around that...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hand of Glory (8,000 gp): Daylight and See Invisibility 1/day to combat those pesky invisible enemies. Also gives an extra ring slot, which is literally epic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hathran Mask of True Seeing (UE, 75,000 gp): Continuous True Seeing. That is all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Masterwork Tool (50 gp): Gives a +2 to any skill check. Masterwork tools come in many shapes and forms, so it’s ok if you can’t imagine exactly what kind of tool improves, say, UMD. It just does.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you must, say the masterwork tool for UMD is a yellow straw hat, blue mage’s robes, and a white porcelain mask.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Necklace of Natural Attacks (SS, ([Enhancement+600)* # of Natural Weapons] gp): Good with Bear Warrior, as improves natural weapons like enhancements. Unfortunately, it takes up the same slot as the Amulet of Health and the Hand of Glory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Powerthirst: Harness the power of 400 babies and run as fast as KENYANS!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ring of Freedom of Movement (PHB, 40,000 gp): Hey, it lets you get to the places you need to be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scabbard of Keen Edges (PHB, 16,000 gp): Better than spending a feat on Improved Critical or money on a Keen weapon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vest of Freedom of Movement (MiC, 12,000 gp): Freedom of Movement for a few rounds a certain number of times per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Winged Vest (MiC, 12,000 gp): Provides a limited ability to fly for cheap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wings of Flying (PHB, 54,000 gp): It lets you fly and remain relevant at higher levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Example Builds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;For what fortress, what city, in the wide extent of the Roman empire, can hope to exist, secure and impregnable, if it is our pleasure that it should be erased from the earth?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Atilla the Hun&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Core Only Barbarian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human Barbarian 1/Fighter 2/Barbarian 17&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Feats:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1: Power Attack&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1: Iron Will&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2: Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Spiked Chain&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3: Combat Reflexes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3: Blind Fight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6: Mounted Combat&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9: Ride By Attack&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12: Spirited Charge&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;15: Leadership&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;18: Mounted Archery&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Core Only Barbarian Dragon Disciple&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Human Barbarian 4/Fighter 2/Sorcerer 2/Dragon Disciple 4/Barbarian 8&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Feats:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1: Power Attack&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1: Iron Will&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3: Combat Reflexes&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5: Improved Initiative&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6: Combat Expertise&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6: Improved Trip&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9: Improved Disarm&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12: Multiattack&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;15: Blind Fight&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;18: Improved Natural Attack: Bite&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You'll need to be careful with your selection of spells, as you have a low caster level and Charisma. Mage Armor and Shield might be useful for combat. Mount is useful. Protection from Evil hedges out mind control, which is always good to have. Feather Fall could save your life. Expeditious Retreat allows you to charge forward into the enemy at a frightening pace. And, of course, there's always Enlarge Person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use Bard levels in place of Sorcerer levels. Your spellcasting is limited to cantrips, but you get to be a Bardbarian.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Horizonwalker Barbarian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ranger1/Barbarian 2/Ranger 2/Fighter 2/Horizon Walker 9/Barbarian 6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Feats:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1: Power Attack, Extra Rage&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3: Improved Bull Rush&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4: Two Weapon Fighting&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5: Endurance&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6: Shock Trooper, Leap Attack&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7: Improved Sunder&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9: Steadfast Determination&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12: Combat Brute&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;15: Battle Jump&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;18: Quicken SLA: Dimension Door (or whatever you want)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Horizon Walker terrains:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Desert: you resist effects that tire you. You are immune to fatigue, and anything that would cause you to become exhausted makes you fatigued instead. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against desert creatures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Forest: You have a +4 competence bonus on Hide checks. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against forest creatures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Marsh: You have a +4 competence bonus on Move Silently checks. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against marsh creatures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hills: You gain a +4 competence bonus on Listen checks. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against hills creatures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Plains: You have a +4 competence bonus on Spot checks. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against plains creatures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Underground : you have 60-foot darkvision, or 120-foot darkvision if you already had darkvision from another source. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against underground creatures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shifting (Planar): You instinctively anticipate shifts in the reality of the plane that bring you closer to your destination, giving you the spell-like ability to use dimension door (as the spell cast at your character level) once every 1d4 rounds. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and elementals native to a shifting plane.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cavernous (Planar): You gain tremorsense with a 30-foot range.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aligned (Planar): You have the instinctive ability to mimic the dominant alignment of the plane. You incur none of the penalties for having an alignment at odds with that of the plane, and spells and abilities that harm those of the opposite alignment don’t affect you. You have the dominant alignment of the plane with regard to magic, but your behavior and any alignment-related Class Features you have are unaffected.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fiery (Planar): This kind of planar terrain mastery provides you with resistance to fire 20. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and elementals with the fire subtype.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cold (Planar): T his kind of planar terrain mastery provides you with resistance to cold 20. You gain a +1 insight bonus on attack and damage rolls against outsiders and elementals with the cold subtype.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Abilities:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pounce&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rage 4/day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sneak Attack +1d6&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Trapfinding&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uncanny Dodge&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10 Terrain Masteries&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Note that the Barbarian actually receives his Dimension Door spell like ability at character level 11, a full level before the monk gets his. Also, you can do it more than one time per day – in fact, you can do it all day long. It just has a cool down of 1d4 founds. The caster level is equal to the Barbarian’s character level instead of half the monk’s class level rounded down.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Control Barbarian&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wolf Totem Barbarian 2 / Fighter 6 / Barbarian 12&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whirling

Valor pleases you, Crom... so grant me one request. Grant me revenge! And if you do not listen, then to HELL with you!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Conan the Cimmerian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In battle: You must charge in and hit things hard with your legendary Barbarian Rage. Then stand still and hit things hard. Intimidate people and/or trip them if you are a control type of Barbarian. Try to protect the squishies so they can rain doom upon your enemies and whatnot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, you must never grapple something larger than you that has any combination of the following: fangs, claws, horns, spikes, tentacles, genitacles, poisonous secretions, negative energy auras, and molecular disintegration fields.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leave that for the monks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Scouting: Growing up in the wilderness and having been raised by wolves and all has made you as sneaky as the best city thief. Use your legendary Barbarian Stealth to your advantage; reconnoiter ahead of the party, sneak around, track enemies, and keep an ear out for danger. Show that rogue how a real man scouts!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Social skills: This is where barbarians really shine; not only do they get Intimidate as a class skill, but they have the huge, bulging muscles to give it a massive circumstance bonus. In addition, diplomacy towards female characters becomes much easier, thanks to your legendary Barbarian Sex Appeal. (May work on the men, too, depending on the kind of Barbarian you play.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enemies and Rivals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The greatest pleasure in life is to crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Conan the Cimmerian&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don’t you mean to say: The greatest pleasure is to vanquish your enemies and chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth and see those dear to them bathed in tears, to ride their horses and clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Genghis Khan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;… I’ll be back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Conan the Terminator&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All that is natural - whether strength of arms, or strength of magic - flows from nature.&amp;nbsp; The druid, the sorcerer, the ranger, and even the bard each pull magic from life.&amp;nbsp; They can be commended. The cleric and the paladin both pull magic from the heavens.&amp;nbsp; Be wary, for though gods may be both good and evil, all are fickle and prone to wrath. Even so, there can be much good in this too, for has not Kord benefited his children for untold millennia?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the wizard… it is the wizard that seeks to grasp the mysteries of the world and tear them asunder. It is the wizard that manipulates nations and the fates of thousands in mad grasps for power. Be wary of any who would impose their will above the will of the land. Nature will exist.&amp;nbsp; Any who defy it will eventually be destroyed by it. The strongest buildings, empires, and monuments are swallowed by forest in time. No, trust not in false promises from those who do not follow nature's order. They are to be destroyed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some may say that another guide for beating mages exists, that a monk has beaten me to the punch. Read on, and I am confident that you will see the light - that at the end of the day, it is cold steel that will do the slaying, not wimpy slapping about. The Barbarian shall be the mage’s bane, and the monk who claims that he is up to the task is merely experiencing delusions of competence. Inept in fighting and inferior in sneaking, only thing the monk can do better than the Barbarian is moving faster, an ability that the Barbarian doesn’t even need as he won’t be running away in shame nearly as often.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, that’s not entirely true. The monk can also fall slowly, resist mundane diseases, heal himself slightly, stun people by blowing, kill someone instantly with acupuncture once a week, and talk to Pocahontas and all her little woodland friends.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The staunch Barbarian can easily match the monk in these fields by taking the damage like a man, drinking orange juice, raging, hitting people with the axe, hitting people harder with the axe, and seducing Pocahontas over a barbeque of woodland friends, respectively.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;“My answer to the accusations of the monk’s effectiveness is below:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;No, it's not possible. Are you ****ing kidding me? Even if you use all of the above advice (which was half thrown together by me so I could type THIS, so maybe you'd better look somewhere else anyways) and get 40 point buy, the Barbarian is still going to take a paddle to you and all you're going to get out of the encounter is humiliation and a red butt!”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Vael, the Optimized Monk Guide&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beating up Batman&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;To those naysayers who are so pessimistic about beating wizards, if they don’t have the guts to try, I call them girlie men!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Conan the Republican&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is not enough that I should succeed – all others must fail!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Genghis Khan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;KHAAAAAAN!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Conan the Chronically Upstaged&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There has long been a misconception among the ‘civilized’ that barbarians only know how to smash things (and people). However, they fail to realize the enormous wizard-killing potential inherent in the Barbarian.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not only is the Barbarian tough enough to survive the wizard’s evocation attacks, but he also has enough fortitude to shrug off many critical spells that target the body. He is also protected against those enchantments that rely on strength of will to work due to his steadfast determination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even the much vaunted battlefield control spells are less of an obstacle for the Barbarian, for he can quickly bypass them with his faster movement speed, jump over them as part of a charge, or if indoors, smash through walls in order to create a new route to his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When charging, a Barbarian can deal enough damage to one-shot even the mightiest of mages. What’s more, due to Barbarian’s natural stealthiness, the wizard will literally never see it coming. It is for no small reason that the fearsome Lion Totem Charge-Pounce Surprise is commonly known as the Barbarian Sneak Attack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The weaker wizards are the easiest to handle with this tactic, as you might expect. One solid strike will often take them out, especially if you target their weak points for massive damage. Wrestling them also works, as they won’t be able to cast spells while grappled, leaving you free to administer the legendary Barbarian Atomic Wedgie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;More experienced wizards require greater cunning to take down, as they will often be Shape Change Astral Projection Ghost Form Displacement Greater Blinking Contingency Celerity Overland Flight Foresighted. One should be careful to avoid direct combat with such powerful wizard at the beginning, instead, perhaps distracting him with expendables. Convincing a bunch of Antimagic Field endowed monks to take him on for you, for example, would be an excellent way of forcing the caster to waste his resources before you had to fight him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Obviously monks are unable to fly, so they will have difficulty reaching a flying and invisible wizard. Your best bet is to pinpoint the wizard by listening carefully and then fling the monk at that general area. This is a surprisingly effective tactic, as the Barbarian can punt a monk further than the monk can run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When the wizard enters the antimagic field, his spells will vanish, causing him to appear and drop to the ground. The flying monk will also get a chance to grapple the wizard in passing, and allowing him to perhaps accomplish one useful thing. The other monks may pull out their wands of Dispel Magic and try to divest the wizard of his many protective spells. Eventually, one of them is bound to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whatever the tactic, the eventual goal is to bring down the caster somehow, preferably with the maximum number of casualties among the monks. After the wizard has been worn down, a simple charge attack is all that is needed to finish him. Even if the wizard is tough enough to deal with the sheer amount of punishment you can dish out, he will still have to contend with the Barbarian’s save or die effect: death from massive damage. This is something that he is unlikely to pass with his weak fortitude save, and what’s more, this save or die can be triggered each round at higher levels, instead of once per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, to take this strategy one step further, one could simply convince two wizards to fight each other by sneaking into one’s tower, defacing the interior, and blaming it on the other wizard, thus ensuring that a feud will develop. Alternatively, a band of adventurers can always be hired at the nearest drinking establishment to troubleshoot a particularly bothersome mage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If all else fails, keep in mind that the wizard's effectiveness is limited to a large extent by the DM; many of the wizard's more powerful spells, ie, Planar Binding or Wish, rely on ambiguous rules interpretation. This is a weak point, as it is therefore subject to DM discretion, unlike partially charged wands and masterwork tools of UMD whose rules are laid down clearly. You can convince the DM to rule in favor of less powerful spells, which will result in less powerful – and more easily killed – wizards.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>Solo</name></author><category term="handbooks" /><category term="35e" /><category term="3.5e" /><summary type="html">Being Bane: A Guide to Cracking Small MenBy Talic, Eldariel, and Solo, who put the whole thing in motion in the first place.Also, thanks to Midnight_V and Zendu for their Barbarian information compilation.“So when can we expect ‘Beating Up Batman: Eldariel’s Guide to Barbarians’?”-SoloWe must pull all the core/non-core materials out that support the mage-killing image that barbarians have justly and obviously earned.-TalicMrifk!

Uncivilized? Fools; you think I'm but an ignorant savage, and I suppose you’ve learned so much that it must be so. But still I cannot see that the savage one is me when there is so much that you don’t know.Consider! Is not the way of the savage the most true to us all? Who among you hasn't known rage at injustice? Who among you can dispute that order lasts only as long as the strength behind it? We, knave, are the strength.Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural; it is a whim of circumstance; it is a sham. All attempts to control the world are doomed to failure, for the civilized man is a very part of the same world that he seeks to control.Barbarism ultimately triumphs over civilization, for only barbarism is eternal and enduring. Civilization is but a luxury that can only be afforded under certain conditions. When the march of civilization halts for a breath, it is invariably destroyed by the Barbarian.So cast off the shackles of your oppression by your laws and lords – what makes them better men than you? Who gave them the right to determine your fate? Renounce the coddling comforts you grew up in and be strong like your forefathers. Reject the two faced nature of civilized life, the complexities, the lies – embrace straightforwardness and honest living. Return to the natural state of being in which you can find peace. Revert to nature, from whence you came.&amp;nbsp;As a Barbarian, you get:Full BABd12 HDGood fortitude save4 skill points/levelIlliteracy: Barbarians are thought so dumb that it’s a class feature!

The reason you should never ever make a Barbarian angry.&amp;nbsp;Fast Movement: Because wildmen are faster than the beer bellied! Awesome already just because you walk faster than Elves, so you can laugh at them even in their one supposed strength. Of course, the true value of this ability is forgetting fast movement and instead learning the cat-like lightning strikes at the end of your charges.&amp;nbsp;Uncanny Dodge: Becomes Improved Uncanny Dodge later. Let’s you stick it to the Rogues (and Monks). Truly, you can do almost anything without being caught flat-footed. Makes you always ready!Trapsense: Sense traps by walking into them, and then shrugging off the damage. This has great value as an ability to lose!Damage Reduction: Useful if you ever need to crash a party through the window. Not enough to actually matter, ever (and Adamantine Full-Plate provides the same, and doesn’t stack so bleh). However, instead of needling yourself until your skin hardens, you can learn to charge at things even better. Or some such. So this has value as something to get rid of.Indomitable Will: A mind of hate does not submit! Works nicely with Steadfast Determination. This ensures that you have two good saves instead of just one, preventing you from being a wizard’s mind controlled buttmonkey. Comes late though, but helps all the same. Teach those weakass staff wavers that it takes more than cute words and magic to get to your...tent.Building a BarbarianArus saw a tall powerfully built youth, naked but for a loin-cloth, and sandals strapped high about his ankles. His skin was burned brown as by the suns of the wastelands and Arus glanced nervously at his broad shoulders, massive chest and heavy arms. From under a mop of unruly black hair smoldered a pair of dangerous blue eyes. A long sword hung in a leather scabbard at his girdle.- Stories of Conan the Cimmerian, The God in the BowlMilitary barracks, fighter academies, and martial temples are the factories that produce warriors for the civilized man. They claim that strict discipline is the only way to turn out dedicated fighting men, that only in order can they be forged. Barbarians who are said to lack the sense of control, discipline, and order, cannot hope to compete.It is strange that we barbarians are considered at odds with order. Chaos is nature's order! The great warriors of old did not become the best through study, or focus, or lessons in a training room. No, true steel comes not from practice but from life, and life alone is a test great enough for the mettle of a true warrior! It is in chaos that the greatest are forged, not in the apostate of 'order', that illusion of control.A Barbarian is strong because rejects the trappings of civilization and order, choosing instead to exist as one with the harshness of nature and be shaped by her rough caresses. A man may travel far and wide, to the ends of the earth, the depths of the sea, and lands beyond the skies, but he will never find a braver, stronger, or tougher man than he who remains uncorrupted by the comforts of civilization.He is as tranquil as the forest, but on fire within; as swift as the coursing river, with the force of a great typhoon; with all the strength of a raging fire, and as mysterious as the dark side of the moon. Truly, only Barbarians have the right to call themselves warriors.AttributesThey shall be my finest warriors, these men who give of themselves to me. Like clay I shall mould them, and in the furnace of war forge them. They will be of iron will and steely muscle. In great armour shall I clad them and with the mightiest guns will they be armed. They will be untouched by plague or disease, no sickness will blight them. They will have tactics, strategies and machines so that no foe can best them in battle. They are my bulwark against the Terror. They are the Defenders of Humanity. They are my Space Marines and they shall know no fear.– The God-Emperor of MankindBarbarians truly are incomparable warriors; mere two attributes give them all they need yet they can expand their options with each and every one! Let me offer you a quick tour of the world of Bane.Strength: Truly, this is what most Barbarians rely on. Not only is it the source of your melee hit and damage, since it’s also the primary attribute boosted by Rage, you pretty much want to build your character around Hulk Smash! This also governs all the martial maneuvers such as Trip, Disarm, Grapple and so on, so Bane is especially well-suited to take advantage!&amp;nbsp;Dexterity: Cartoons teach us that agility beats strength. This is not precisely true, but what is true is that acting fast, dodging blows and in general, gaining extra value out of your HP is great added to immense strength. Also, this fuels some Barbarian feats and makes Archerians happen. Ferocious Barbarians can even build around this in the melee! No, not necessary, but handy.&amp;nbsp;Constitution: Your chest muscle. You know every Barbarian ever has huge chest muscles! Barbarians even gain damage reduction or AC bonus due to their immensity! This is your primary defense; Fireball? You block with your chest! Sword? You block with your chest! Finger of Death? You block with your chest! With the right choices, you’ll even block Dominate Person with your chest! Basically, whatever happens, if something hits you, you block with your chest, so better make sure you have a damn huge chest to block with! Also, makes you slow to abate…which is awesome because your anger is your strength!&amp;nbsp;Intelligence: Ah yes, the archetype of the stupid Wildman who goes Hulk Smash when you tell him to. But no, you’re your own man and you decide for yourself when you go Bruce Banner. This can be worth it, this can be not worth it. For the savvy hunters who fuel their Rage into lethal determination for swift kills, this is very much worth it. For the Conan who just battles an army and comes out victorious, this is unnecessary. In general, the northerners who worship the wolves have less need for this than those who follow less savage beasts.&amp;nbsp;Wisdom: You, who hail from the savage lands, carry great Wisdom within. There is much you understand the city-fools cannot even hope to begin to comprehend. You know why the wind whispers, you know why the tree dies. You understand the ways of the sun and the moon and you know why the wolf bites. This is what you’re trained at. Oh, and protecting your mind is worth all the trouble…unless you do it with your chest, like everything else. Still, you can learn where traps lie and you can hear the breathing of the Wizard who would lurk nigh’.&amp;nbsp;Charisma: Take me for a savage will you? Consider me little more than a wild beast? Little do you know, little indeed. Where do you think my Rage comes if not from my strength of mind? Why do you think even a Dragon stirs in my presence if not for the force of my presence? No, not all Barbarians are withdrawn and weak of will. Some of us have force and the ways to bring our minds’ crushing might down upon our enemies! Indeed, some of us may be peasants, but there are kings in our ranks too! For the Barbarians of leadership and fear, this is the way!RacesOomans are pink and soft, not green and tough like da Boyz. They'z all the same size, too - No big'uns or little'uns, so they'z always arguing about who's in charge, 'cos there's no way of telling 'cept for badges an' ooniforms and fings. Anuvver fing - when they do sumfink, they try to make it look like somfink else to confuse everybody.

An' while they'z all arguin' wiv each other over who's da Boss, da Orks can sneak up an' clobber da lot.- Snotgrub the Ork explains his views of humanity and its failingsJust as not all Halflings are Rogues, and not all pansies are Elves, not all Barbarians are Human. All races started out the same when the world was born; Humans, Dwarves, Orcs, and Halflings were all proud, strong people in the beginning. The only exceptions were the Elves, who immediately formed the world’s first tea party after their first tree hugging session.Now the Elves are as decadent as ever, while the Halflings for the most part have settled into a quiet complacency, refusing even to venture out of their comfortable little holes. Only the cruel – smelly – Orcs, monstrous races, along with a handful of sturdy – often inebriated – Dwarves and brave Humans adhere to the ways of our ancestors.What race produces the best Barbarians? I find this a foolish question, as there are so many individual factors and variations between the members of a race that is it impossible to answer. The question itself is impossibly vague: best at doing what?Instead, allow me to list the general features of the most common races, which is a far easier task to accomplish.Orcs are physically stronger and tougher than Humans, though they often seem a bit dumber by comparison. Why this is, no one knows, for surely Gruumsh would have had an easier time conquering the world if his creations were smart enough to do so without stabbing themselves in the foot. However, those intelligent enough to follow orders well are also intelligent enough to question those orders, and that is something the One-Eyed Ravager will never allow. Of special note are the Orcs of Water [UA]; the element blessed them with extra resilience only matched by that of the Dwarves.The Dwarves, old as the mountains and a great deal tougher, are renowned for their metallurgical skills, even amongst those who have rejected civilization. It is only natural that the children of Moradin, who sprung from stone themselves, have an affinity with the earth. Dwarves are the most resilient among the Barbarian races, able to shrug off physical blows, poison, and magical spells with the same ease as you or I would shake off the rain. Again of note are the Dwarves of Water [UA], for they draw strength from their element, and the Dwarves of Earth [UA] who can outdo even the great resilience of the Shield Dwarves.Humans, by contrast, have no special abilities; we have not hide, nor claws, nor fangs; we cannot breath fire or secrete poison; nor can we see far in darkness, or even in dim light. Though Humans lack the abilities of other races, they are tenacious and determined, forever confronting and adapting to new situations, and sometimes that is enough to succeed. While Elves and Dwarves each maintain that their respective race was the first to be created, but I cannot help but wonder sometimes if Humans were the first; created by an unnamed source as the template on which other races were further developed by their own patron gods.The great variety of Humans out there provides basis for a great variety of Barbarians too; normal Humans are great intelligent warriors of wonderful versatility, the Neanderthals [Frost] of Frostfell draw upon the power of our ancestors, while Mongrelfolk [RoD] are of even greater resilience than the Dwarves, and yet all are derived from humankin. Truly, there are more different kinds of Barbarians between the Human-races than all the others combined.And just like Human himself is mighty as a Barbarian, so are their creations – the Warforged [RoE] are made for battle and their sentience gives them the choice of following their creators’ footsteps and invoking their rage as extra strength. Their fearsome reputation is well-deserved; little is more frightening than a machine that thinks and acts like a man. While Dwarves have great resiliency, Warforged by the virtue of being only semi-alive have complete immunity to much that would ail even toughest humanoids.Few words of the grander races, barbarians thrive in their midst. Goliaths [RoS], Half-Ogres [RoD], Centaurs, Ogres and the like all produce great barbarians in both, numbers and power. Truly, when strength is the measure stick, size is a great gift. A word of warning though, the larger races lead slow lives; when a Human has mastered his craft, they are only beginning. So respect them for their might, but remember that they lose out in skill.Just like the older in our midst, the descendants of the planar creatures still hold fast to the ways of Barbarians. The so-called “Lesser Genasi”, hailing from Faerun [PGtF], have great history as Barbarians of great might. The descendants of the fiends too, while more at home in shadows, have a history of making great Barbarians if that is the road they have chosen. The descendants of celestials though are ill-suited for this path for the contemplation and meditation does not sit well into a life by the sword.And one more mention, of the children of Bahamut – just like Moradin’s made his children of great resilience, so too does Bahamut gift those he grants rebirth. The Dragonborn [RotD] of any kind are grand in endurance and any of the three gifts is of great use to Barbarians of their kind. Of special note are the wings; few winged folk have the strength and resolve to live the life of a Barbarian – the Dragonborn do just that. Verily, the Dragonkin demands and deserves our respect still.Of final note are the races who still live in the wilderness like our ancestors; Feral [SS] Human is at least as strong as Orc and still twice as adaptable. The Mineral Warriors [Und] from the depths of the Earth are nearly impossible to kill and strong all the same. The common races all exist as both and while few in numbers; the few choose the path of Barbarians almost without exception. This makes them match up well to the Barbarian representatives of their more “civilized” counterparts.Halflings and Gnomes shall be lumped together, as both make poor Barbarians; Halflings are best off as thieves, and Gnomes should be casting illusions – or blowing themselves up with crazy inventions for the great justice. Small size, small strength and small weapons do not a traditional Barbarian make. Some Barbarians rely on agility, not strength, and mayhap their ranks are filled with the small folk, but truly, can a Barbarian without strength be called a Barbarian anymore?The halfbreed races are even more ill-suited to barbarism: True, the Half-Orc is slightly stronger than the average Human, but as we have seen with the Orcs, strength must go hand in hand with intellect if anything meaningful is to be accomplished. While Half-Orcs may make strong warriors, they cannot think well for themselves and fail at one of the central tenants of barbarism, the ability to survive by one’s own wits in the wild. Verily, true-blood Orcs are the barbarians of that family. Half-Orcs are still better Barbarians than anything else, but better than bad is merely a meaningless victory over something not worth defeating.Half-Elves are even worse. I ask you, what is a Half-Elf going to do in a fight, talk himself out of it? Is he going to ask the land politely to give him something to eat? Or convince a deer that its flank is really better off in his stomach? Worthless bastards to a man!However, as bad as these races are, the complete antithesis to the idea of barbarism is the Elf, who spends his days idling amongst flowers, smoking grass, and singing to the trees. The only productive things the elves have produced in their entire existence is magic; and even that was taken from the dragons, has caused as much harm as good in this world, and has been slowly declining in their decadence, for it is often said that the old magics were much stronger than the ones they use now, and the secrets of which have been forgotten.So much for the better. While magic is on the decline, and civilizations wane in complacency, barbarism shall triumph.SkillsBeat your thoughts to the mould of your will.-Leman Russ, the Great Wolf King of FenrisClass skills&amp;nbsp;Climb: You can kill things by climbing to them. Or climbing them. Or you can just smack the caster until he makes you fly. Your choice.Handle Animal: Cityscape allows you to use this as a Gather Information check. Unfortunately, it means you don’t get to hold people over the sides of buildings while demanding “WHERE IS JIMMY THE MOLE”, so it’s a bit of a tradeoff.Intimidate: Otherwise known as 'Klingon diplomacy', this skill allots you to scare things to death. Might require a few feats to be worth overcoming your possible Cha penalty, but there’s nothing quite frightening as an angry Barbarian with a way with words! Your chest muscles should give you epic circumstance bonuses - it has even been suggested in Masters of the Wild (3.0) that Barbarians get +4 bonus to intimidate and be allowed to use their Strength bonus instead of Charisma if an act of might is part of the intimidate check.Jump: If you don’t have Leap Attack, this is replaceable with Fly. You should never not have Leap Attack. Kill things by jumping them! You can also jump on them should you so desire.Listen: This allows you to avoid ambushes and to figure out what’s being whispered behind your back. You have d12 HD and Uncanny Dodge, but if you invest in it maybe the d4 caster you break will give you some nice gear.Survival: TRAPS WILL FALL AT YOUR HANDS!!! Also, you apparently will never have to spend 5 silver on rations or something like that. Trapkiller makes this worth it. See the ACF section.Ride: You run as fast as a horse anyway (unless you traded Fast Movement for something good) and Survival is a class skill, so you have no need for Emergency Rations. Let the Paladin Ride on the high horse and fall tumbling down when you run into yet another bunch of otherworldly horrors the horse can't stand.Tumble: Cityscape allows you to trade Ride for Tumble. Tumble is much better than ride. Even without Cityscape, max this, no matter how fruity the description is. Basically, you can play &quot;can't catch me&quot; with that guy's guisarme until you get bored and cram a block of wood through his guts. It also allows a derogatory dancing in the face of Elves, and they can't even make attacks of opportunity to stop you!&amp;nbsp;Cross ClassBluff: “Remember when I said I’d kill you last? I lied.”If you’re building for Intimidate, this gives you another +2 at the cost of 5 ranks. And hey, lying never hurt anybody at all. Trust me.Balance: You may be able to kill the Tarrasque in one swing, but without 5 ranks, 1st level Wizards can still mess you up.Spot: The same as listen, except this time it is even more reasonable to shove the Wizard’s gift down his throat and tell him to avoid his own damn ambushes. Only worth it if you have nothing better to spend ranks on.Hide/Move Silently: You can kill people by sneaking up to them. Or you can just make the Rogue sneak, and beat him whenever he’s detected. Your choice.Use Magic Device: You can kill people with magic. Or use magic to make yourself stronger then kill people personally. (The Flexible Mind feat makes this a permanent class skill for you.)Skill TricksClarity of Vision: If you’re in a build that happens to meet the Spot requirement, this is nice for beating on the cowards who try to avoid you, but it’s not worth the investment otherwise. Requires Spot twelve (12!) ranks, which you must study other ways to even be able to reach it before the end of your path. That said, seeing things is a very Barbarian thing to do!Extreme Leap: If you’re a Leap Attacker, this is right up your alley. Worth it if you can spare the ranks. Needs 5 in Jump, which you should have anyways. Jump more!Never Outnumbered: Demoralize multiple targets simultaneously. Prerequisite of 8 skill ranks. Truly at home for those who would roar before charge; then everyone can cower when ye roar!Nimble Charge: Charge over difficult terrain. Grab this. Needs 5 Ranks in Balance, which you should always have as a charger.Point It Out: If you have the ranks in Spot, might as well, but don’t worry about it otherwise. You can show the doofuses that yes, it actually is an ambush. You don't really care since you're always ready, but Squishy McSquishon might get squished before he can act otherwise. Requires 8 ranks.Spot the Weak Point: Great for fighting high-armor characters like the stupid smug Fighter or his prancing buddy the Warblade, take it if you meet the prerequisites. Needs, again, 12 ranks in Spot.Twisted Charge: Turn during a charge. Grab this. The guy to your left laughs at you as you charge towards a wall only to recieve a surprise Greatsword to the face! His face both, before and after the blow make this definitely worth it. Needs 5 Ranks in Balance and Tumble, which are both good investments anyways.FeatsStomp ‘em! Stomp ‘til there is nuthin’ left!-Battlecry of the KillcrushasFundamentals: Core &amp;amp; SRDLeadership (Character Level 6) [PHB]: Über [cheese]! The most powerful feat in D&amp;amp;D. Gets you a second character and a bunch of sycophants who could e.g. spread stories of your grandeur and bask in your glory. The true reason for this feat though is that every great Barbarian needs a beautiful Bard cohort of the opposite sex to sing of your great deeds, to improve your performance (and to use magic (items) for you!) and to relieve stress overnight!Power Attack (Str 13) [PHB]: OMGWTFBBQ?! Trade attack bonus for damage, at a 1 for 2 ratio when wielding a weapon in two hands. This is basically a Barbarian class feature. Don't forget that it actually lacks prerequisites.Improved Bull Rush (Power Attack, Str 13) [PHB]: Necessary evil. You need it to qualify for Shock Dragoon™-combo! Besides, sometimes it’s cool to push people around. Rawr!Cleave (Str 13, Power Attack) [PHB]Combat Reflexes (Dex 13) [PHB]: Wonderful! Truly, life is boring when it's not your turn. You get to do nothing...except with this! Rules state that you stay still on your turn, but this allows you to Screw the Rules! You have the enormous chest to pull it off. Trip opponent, he gets up, make him Stand Still! Someone hits you, Robilar’s Gambit him back! Yes, attacking out of turn is always good fun (for you), especially after a full attack yourself! This lets you do it a lot, and do it while you’re flat-footed!Stand Still (Str 13) [XPH]: Good! Forgo an AoO to force an opponent to make a reflex save or remain in place. Reflex save DC is equal to your damage. Your massive, massive damage. Help those fools you tripped to stay down!Improved Unarmed Strike [PHB]: Ok. Sometimes you just have to rebuild someone’s face with your bare hands. This feat allows you to do just that. Your damage die will suck, but that’s what Power Attack and strength are for.Improved Grapple (Dex 13, Improved Unarmed Strike) [PHB]: Ok. Grappling is a problem-laden area of combat. Size is the primary means of boosting it, which almost always favours the monsters. Freedom of Movement is commonly available on higher levels. And you open your back to all manners of depravity. That said, Barbarian is by far the best man for this job out of all the non-casters. This also makes the Barbarian the best man for the job in an Anti-Magic Field, period. Big HP, huge Str &amp;amp; full BAB are really all you can hope for in a Grapple. Not very good outside duels, but if you must be a grappler, at least be a Barbarian!Improved Initiative [PHB]: Yeah! +4 Initiative, no frills, no pills. Simple deal; you act first so that they never need to act at all! Relieve your opponents of the stress of preparing for their deaths and kill them before they know what hit them! It’s best for everyone this way. If you have extras, feel free to pick this.Rapid Shot (Dex 13, Point Blank Shot): Yes! For the Archer in us all! Never arrive in a bowout without this in your back pocket. Your usual Hulk needn’t bother, but if you’re interested in making holes in your foes’ foreheads rather than pulverizing them, this is for you!Precise Shot (Point Blank Shot): Might as well. If you plan on shooting at people, this allows you to shoot at the right people. If it’s your career, go ahead. Otherwise, pass.Precise Shot (Dex 19, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, BAB +11): It’s ok. This is Improved Shooting At The Right People. If you make a career out of shooting things, go ahead. Otherwise, pass.Combat Expertise (Int 13) [PHB]: Necessary evil if limited to Core. Truly, if you have access to other books, you should never need to bother being a smart combatant; this stuff cramps your style, but acquiring abilities to knock people down, hit them for hitting you and so on can just be worth it. The reason to be a smart Barbarian.Improved Trip (Int 13, Combat Expertise) [PHB]: Awesome! Lets you trip things, as well as giving you a free attack when you successfully trip someone, and another one when they get up. Oh, and you get to touch things instead of hitting them even with iteratives. Much easier, not to mention more pleasant. Wolves learn this whether they have Expertise or not. Prerequisite for…Knock-Down (Str 15, Improved Trip, BAB +2) [SRD]: Great! Whenever you deal 10 or more damage to a target, you get a free trip attempt against them. You see where this is going… As a bonus, you get to pretend to be the schoolyard bully, knocking people around as you walk past. The only difference is that you knock them off their feet with a 10' blade or bear claws. While the said blade/claw is in their gut.Reckless Offense (BAB +1) [XPH]: Somewhat worthwhile. If you have nothing better to use your feat on (as is like to be the case in Core), this is ok. Extra Power Attack; it's not like you'd been dodging hits anyways.Exotic Weapon Proficiency (BAB +1) [PHB]: Depends. Well, by and large Exotic Weapons have 1 size larger damage die than normal weapons (in other words, they suck). However, there’s one weapon of interest especially to two-handed charger/controller Barbarians: the Spiked Chain. Yes, the dumbest weapon in D&amp;amp;D also happens to be the best. It trips, disarms, deals two-handed reach damage, threatens adjacent and just has the whole damn packet. If you have the feat to burn and don’t mind dumb weapons, it’s for you.Weapon Focus (BAB +1) [PHB]: Bleh. Feel free if you’re run out of everything else to pick. Do take 4 Fighter-levels for Specialization if you really are going to bother. Archers can get something out of these. Most don’t. But meh.Weapon Finesse (BAB +1) [PHB]: Useless in core, but believe it or not, it is possible to make a Dex-focused Barbarian with additional material! Yes, it involves Chain Dancing.The Tools of Trade: Completes, Races of &amp;amp; PHBIILeap Attack (Jump 8 ranks, Power Attack) [CAdv]: Superb! Quadruple double handed damage bonus from Power Attack if you jump more than 10 feet while charging. The higher you are, the harder they fall!Shock Trooper (Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, BAB +6) [CW]: Just plain Barbarian! Assign your Power Attack penalty to your armor class. Basically, trade blows with you hitting twice as hard and lasting twice as long. Like everything Barbarian, this just ain’t fair!Rampaging Bull Rush (Improved Bull Rush, Rage, Large or Larger) [RoS]: Ok! Take -4 on Bull Rush to knock opponent prone instead. Certainly useful! Although Knock-Down and Improved Trip do place in question the feat’s necessity.Knockback (Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Large or Larger) [RoS]: Good! Whenever you hit opponent with Power Attack, you can knock them around a bit! Combined with Shock Trooper, you can do all sorts of ugly things with this!Combat Brute (Improved Sunder, Power Attack, BAB +6) [CW]: Decent when no must-haves are left. Gives three abilities, two of which are ok (basically, allow you to break Hydras; turns out Hercules was a Combat Brute Barbarian). The third allows you to increase the multiplier on your Power Attack in the round after you charge an enemy. Combine with the above to create the Shock Dragoon Brute OMGWTFBBQ™ chain! So you hit someone really hard, and follow it up with an even harder hit. First charge kills a mook, and leaves you in a position to Combat Brutalize the BBEG!Evasive Target (Dodge, Mobility, BAB +6) [CW]: Useful. As we covered before, your AC probably sucks. It also probably sucks some more Charging and all that. If fighting other melee beasts, the ability to ignore their Power Attack is literally a lifesaver. Really enhances the value of whatever life you have. Only drawback is that you have to learn useless crap to acquire it, but hey, greatness at any cost!Deft Opportunist (Dex 15, Combat Reflexes) [CAdv]: Worthwhile. Most Barbarians focus on beating their opponents to bloody pulp on Charges and what-have-you. Some deft ones have opted for a bit different approach though; let the adversaries approach, rip their faces apart while stopping their movement and let them try until they die! For those, Ferocity and Deft Opportunist are great options!Karmic Strike (Dex 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge) [CW]: Awesome! The only drawback to this feat are the prerequisites. Expertise, Dodge? Phah, you’re a Barbarian, damnit! But the ability to hit the opponent for every time he hits you is just golden. Especially awesome when you did your Shock Dragoon Charge!Robilar’s Gambit (Combat Reflexes, BAB +12) [PHBII]: Über! Make your own rules, damnit! This one makes yourself more vulnerable in exchange for an obscene number of attacks on your opponent – if you survive. Once again, embodies the Barbarian ideal of “The first one to die loses!” Generally, the man with bigger HD, damage, Con, Str and more attacks wins, and as a Barbarian you have all of the above!Mage Slayer (Spellcraft 2 ranks, BAB +3) [CArc]: The right tool for the job. If you are to slay mages, become a Mage Slayer. The benefits are small, but notable: You learn to better shield your mind and you learn to break the defenses in their spellcasting! Truly, if a mage approaches a Slayer Barbarian, he is not long for this world! Do mind the Spellcraft requirement though.Pierce Magical Concealment (Con 13, Blind-Fight, Mage Slayer) [CArc]: World-changing! See the world for what it truly is, without the impact of magic! You may need Blind-Fight, but truly, the mages who would seek to deceive you are in for a crude awakening when they strive to unearth the Glaive stuck in the approximate center of their heart.Intimidating Strike (Intimidate 4 ranks) [PHBII]: You take a standard action to make a single melee attack that intimidates your foe! In addition, you may take a penalty to your attack roll up to your base attack bonus, and add it to the intimidate check. Useful with Imperious Command.Intimidating Rage (Rage) [CW]: Great! As a free action, intimidate one person within 30 feet when starting a rage, forcing him to become shaken for the duration of the rage. [b]This[/b] is why Barbarians truly are charismatic.Instantaneous Rage (Rage) [CW]: Reasons exist to take it. Allows you to activate your rage as a free action, even during other people’s turn. Worthwhile options if your Rage is of a flavor other than Ferocity, when combined with means to yell really hard.Intimidating Rage (Rage) [CW]: Great! As a free action, intimidate one person within 30 feet when starting a rage, forcing him to become shaken for the duration of the rage. This is why Barbarians truly are charismatic.Extra Rage (Rage) [CW]: Useful. Gives your 2 more rage attempts per instance of feat taken. Rage all day, every day! The feat for first level play.Reckless Rage (Rage) [RoS]: Handy! Take an additional -2 to AC when raging for an additional +2 to strength and constitution. Emphasizes the Barbarian ideal of “let them hit and hit back harder!”Steadfast Determination (Endurance) [PHBII]: Yes! Con modifier instead of Wisdom modifier to will saves. I’m sorry, but these *are* the Warforged we are looking for! As a Barbarian, your Rage and Indomitable Will both already help your Will, so the more, the merrier! Oh, and no more natural 1s on Fort-saves; for a Barbarian, that means practical immunity!Channeled Rage (Half-Orc, Rage) [RoD]: Yeah! One good reason to be a Half-Orc. You can burn a Rage to punch the opponent out of your head; literally! Adds your massive, massive Str to Will-saves. That said, the cost is something to mind; not requiring Endurance is definite boon though.Extend Rage (Rage) [CW]: Blah. You can Rage longer. The thing is, Rage is already 3+Con turns. Your Con should be in the lower stratospheres. If you can’t make problems go away in that time, something else is wrong than the duration of your Rage. And if your Con is low enough to warrant this, you might as well start with your memorial instead of taking this.Goad (Cha 13, BAB +1) [CAdv]: Superfluous. Generally, cleaving a line of heads off is plenty of an incentive for people to come hit you. If it’s not, cleave another one. Charismatic Barbarians frighten people into submission; they don’t beg to be attacked. Leave that to Monks. Oh yeah, and this gives them a Will-save vs. your Cha and only restricts their melee attacks. Just don’t bother.Gnoll Ferocity (Gnoll, Rage) [RotW]: Fun. If you somehow ended up a Gnoll, getting that extra Bite out of your Rage is never a bad thing. Although if you become a Bear, it’s wasted.Destructive Rage (Rage) [CW]: This feat tastes bad. You can break things just fine with Rage + Power Attack. Also, you shouldn’t be breaking things often enough to need this. No, this is just bad.Improved Toughness (Fort +2) [CW]: Decent. In case you still somehow missed it, Barbarians are all about getting hit and hitting back harder. Extra HP help with that. Relatively small boost for a Barbarian though.Improved Buckler Defense (Shield Proficiency) [CW]: Decent. Making shields obsolete since 2003! If you have the feat to spare, go for it and save the Animated-money.Mad Foam Rager (Rage) [PHBII]: Ok. You get to play the “I’ll never die alone!”-shtick! Aside from the coolness-factor, the feat unfortunately has little going on for it alone; if you happen to have a Cleric nearby though, the ailment can be cured. If you had an abundance of feats, every Barbarian should have this, but alas, the limited supply keeps this from being the Awesome it deserves.Ragewild Fighting (Shifter, Power Attack, BAB +6) [RoE]: Decent. You get three maneuvers, none of which are too amazing. First gives you free attack when someone enchants you. Better make that count (better plan is not to get controlled in the first place though). Second dazes your size-or-smaller opponents when Power Attacking. Not bad, but it’s weird if they’re alive after two rounds of Power Attacks. Third enables using Action Points for extra damage. Sure, why not.Three Mountains Style (Str 13, Cleave, Improved Bull Rush, Power Attack, Weapon Focus: Heavy mace, Morningstar or Greatclub) [CW]: Decent. The only two-handed weapon style feat; this is actually rather good. You force a strength-based save vs. Nausea, a very powerful condition. The only drawback is that if you hit someone twice already, why isn’t he dead, and if he isn’t dead, how do you plan on making him fail a Fort-save? If you aren’t charging (because it’s been nerfed or whatever), but are more of the stand-up kind of guy, this may be worthwhile.Jotunbrud (Illuskan or Damaran Human, 1st level) [RoF]: Yeah! You’re treated as Large whenever it’s beneficial for you. Basically, you get Powerful Build as a Human. Besides, you get to be a descendant of Giants! And yeah, you just kick some ass.&amp;nbsp;The Final Frontier: All the rest&amp;nbsp;Poison Healer (Great Fortitude, Con 13) [FC1]: You heal a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier whenever you successfully resist poison. A barbarian's massive fortitude save and constitution score means that he can get good mileage out of this, even without Steadfast Determination. This is not a powerful feat, as it is only good for out of combat healing (without employing shenanigans, at least), but healing wounds by consuming alcohol is always fun.Imperious Command (Cha 15) [DoTU]: Yes! Demoralized opponent cowers for 1 round, then shaken for 1 round. This is why the charismatic Barbarians rule! The beauty of this is just beyond description; you need but show them your angry face and they bask in your glory (and you can proceed to decapitate the whole bunch should that strike your fancy)!Frightful Presence (Cha 15, Intimidate 9 ranks) [Drac]: Decent. Whenever you attack or charge, all opponents within a radius of 30 feet who have fewer levels or Hit Dice than you become shaken for a number of rounds equal to 1d6 + your Cha modifier. Combine with your Bard-cohort’s Inspire Greatness to make even greater Demons cry!Martial Study [ToB]: For purists only. Opens up a can of kung-fu fighting. It’s like 10 gallons of pure awesome squeezed into a 2 gallon jug. Some prefer dipping, but pure-bloods can consider this to acquire great examples of Barbarism such as Iron Heart SURGE!Martial Stance [ToB]: Great! If you feel dipping to be wrong, this enables you to acquire the wondrous things known as “stances”. There’s an especially useful one named “Thicket of Blades”, which enables you to make any movement in your area provoke an attack of opportunity. Never let people approach you again!Evasive Reflexes (Dex 13) [ToB]: Great. When you hit someone and tank your AC, not being next to them when they hit back can help. If you happen to have this feat called Robilar’s Gambit, every one of their attacks provokes an attack of opportunity. This here feat means that you can take a 5’ step every time that happens. So one attack later, you’re out of their threatened area and their full attack is wasted!Sidestep (Dex 15, Dodge, Mobility, Tumble 8 ranks) [MiniHB]: Heh. Once per turn, you can replace an attack of opportunity with a 5’ step! Woot! Dodge full attacks! Wait...what manner of tool wrote those prerequisites? Yeah, take Evasive Reflexes. Calling this “bad” is the understatement of the year.Large and In Charge (Reach 10’ or more, Large or Larger) [Drac]: Cool. Sort of like Knockback! You can make attacks of opportunity to move opponent back 5’ and stop their movement. Easy to pick up too! And it’s just a plain Strength-check.Righteous Wrath (Rage, Exalted) [BoED]: Just maybe... Now, the benefits are pretty worthless, even for a charismatic Barbarian, as the target is only shaken and only after a hit. The better part is that you can control yourself; mayhap you can tame the Frenzied Berserker within!Dragon Rage (Dragon Totem, Rage, Argonnesse, BAB +4): Decent. When you Rage, get +2 Natural Armor and Energy Resistance +10 (for a total of 15) vs. your chosen Totem’s energy type!Frozen Berserker (Rage) [Frost]: Mediocre if not using trickery. When raging, you become a chunk of ice! Makes you immune to cold. The drawback is that you hate fire. Unless you already have Fire immunity anyways. This isn't exactly Super Special Awesome™, but it enables Frostrager.Blazing Berserker (Rage) [Sand]:&amp;nbsp; Mediocre if not using trickery. When raging, you become a living inferno! So you’re immune to fire. Doesn’t burn people you touch, oddly enough. You can combine this with the above to gain elemental immunity to Fire &amp;amp; Ice. Plus you get to be a burning chunk of ice. That’s fairly awesome.Cobalt Rage (Con 13, Rage) [MoI]: Yeah! You can invest essential into your Rage to get melee damage- and Will-save bonus for the Rage! Oh, and you get bonus essential. If you intend on fooling around with Incarnum, this is your ticket.Frantic Rage (Rage, Madness-domain) [FoE]: Yeah! As is appropriate, the dexterous Barbarian is an idea of Madness; truly, you must be mad to be agile instead of strong! This feat empowers you for a completely different approach to Barbarianism!Shadow Blade (Shadow Hand stance) [ToB]: Yeah! For the quick Barbarian in us all! Limits you to Shadow Hand-weapons, but luckily an old friend looks back at us; that’s right, Spiked Chain is a Shadow Hand weapon! All you lose is the 1½ damage bonus normal Str-Barbarian enjoys. All the other multipliers are right there. Your Unarmed Strikes also enjoy this bonus, and you have the option of going Two-Weapon Fighting with your Dexterity. And you’ll have an actual AC!Ettercap Berserker (Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Decent. Gain +2 on poison saves and gain an added +2 Bonus to Con when raging. +4 at greater rage. For those who missed it, Barbarism is all about having the biggest chest muscles!Ice Troll Berserker (Con 13, Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Decent. +2 natural armor bonus while raging +4 with Greater Rage. For the Barbarians who seek to block blows with their chest instead of absorbing them!Snow Tiger Berserker (Dex 13, Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Great if you’re a bear! You gain Pounce…that only works with light weapons. Why am I mentioning this? Why, natural attacks and unarmed strikes are always treated as light weapons. Does the name &quot;Bear Warrior&quot; say anything to you? It will soon.Wolf Berserker (Lodge Membership, Rage, Rashemen) [UE]: Superb! Replaces Combat Expertise as a prerequisite for Improved Trip. Yes, and also provides stacking +4 bonus on Tripping. Oh, and +4 to resist Tripping. Yes! YES!Eagle Tribe Vision (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: Ok. +5 to Spot. Not much to...see here.Hyena Tribe Hunter (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: Decent. +2 Hide, +2 Trip, qualifies you for Improved Trip. Handy if you really, really want to pimp out those Trip-checks. Loses out to Wolf Berserker, but why couldn't you be a tribe member in the Shaar and a Lodge member in Rashemen?Lion Tribe Warrior (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: Mediocre. You gain Pounce with a single light weapon, or two attacks with two light weapons you can wield. Ok for an Unarmed Barbarian, but frankly, Snow Tigers whop Lions' arse any day.Rhinoceros Tribe Charge (Tribe membership, Human, from the Shaar) [SSouth]: For the early game! Extra 2d6 damage on charge. Unfortunately it can only be applied to one attack, trivial later on.Headlong Charge (Orc or half-orc, base attack bonus +4 or higher)[RoF]: You provoke an AoO from everyone you charge past, including your target. In return, you deal double damage on a charge. Is nice.Might Makes Right (Str 13, Leadership)[RoF]: This adds your Strength bonus to your leadership score for the purposes of determining how many followers you may have with the Leadership feat. If you take Leadership, you might as well take this.Class Features VariantsHe is a barbarian, and thinks that the customs of his tribe and island are the laws of nature.-George Bernard Shaw, Caesar and CleopatraTotems [UA]A Barbarian becomes like the animal he worships as his totem. The limited Barbarians you meet in the pages of Player’s Handbook only give you one option: Worship the Jaguar (they don’t even tell that to you)! However, Player’s Handbook is only a world pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. SRD offers the tools for those seeking to worship other animals! There are also the Spiritual Totems for those who own the path of Champions [CC], but not all animals allow you to serve two masters; although you may discuss with your world master on if you could give up some of your Totem’s abilities for the spiritual aspect even if the book does not give you the tools – allow me to suggest unto Thee to forsake the ability of the same level for the ability the Spirit offers instead. The Totems open to every Barbarian:&amp;nbsp;Ape: The Ape is the most Humanoid-like of all the Totems and thus, instead of animalistic skills, you learn what every humanoid Barbarian does: to strengthen your blows. The Ape also masters trees and puts fear in your enemies, but he’s not as fast nor as careful as the Jaguar on open ground. Unfortunately, the Ape requires your dedicated service; his servants may not serve spiritual totems without divine intervention. The Ape is well-suited for agile Barbarians as you still acquire Power Attack in spite of your probably poor Strength. The bonus to intimidate means it is also a viable part of an intimidating build.&amp;nbsp;Bear: The Bear is an intimate animal; where a normal Barbarian learns to avoid, those to the likeness of the Bear learn to hug! Friends don’t let friends retain Toughness beyond level 3, but lenient creators of the world make you acquire the Improved version [CW] instead. In their world, the Bear is the mighty animal it should be! Like the Ape, the Bear is jealous of the spirits and requires you to remain worldly.&amp;nbsp;Boar: What defines the Boar is greater intensity than that of the other animals. Alas, this is help the Barbarian does not need. The Jaguar’s servants are plenty resilient and the intensity the Boar adds is nothing compared to the speed and the vigilance of the Jaguar. Like the others, the Boar does not permit spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;Dragon: Ah, the mighty Dragon! The Dragon teaches you to…frighten your opponents. And to fight without your eyes. And to resist weak magical attacks. Apparently, the Dragon is too jealous of its own secrets to spare its majestic power for its totemists. That said, the frightful presence is not entirely wasted; indeed, the intimidator Barbarian can find some use for it. The servants of the Dragon, more than anyone else, need their Bard cohort to sing for their might. The Dragon is like the others and by the book, does not look kindly upon spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;Eagle: The keen-eyed eagle is more vigilant than the others. Indeed, while it cannot match the Jaguar’s speed, it sees better and anticipates the coming spells. Alas, the Eagle’s servants do not get spot in class (talk with your DM if interested in this), so his gifts are somewhat wasted. Once again, no spirits for the Eagle.&amp;nbsp;Horse: As you might imagine, the horse is a fast, hardy runner. However, it’s yet another gift few Barbarians have use for; your speed is already greater than that of your comrades, and further speed only breaks the group more. No, the Horse is truly right only for very few. On the bright side, it does not preclude the spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;Jaguar: The majority of Barbarians serve the Jaguar, without even knowing it. It’s a kind master, teaching speed and vigilance, and allowing for the service of the spirits. Indeed, because the option given to you as the “only” one is so pleasant, few even bother to consider the alternatives. The Jaguar allows for spiritual service.&amp;nbsp;Serpent: Much like the Bear, the Serpent learns to grapple, just a bit later. Unlike the Bear, the Serpent relies on stealth and speed while the Bear relies on endurance and strength in grapple to overcome his opponent. The two are interestingly similar, yet different paths. Like the Bear, the Serpent doesn’t have spiritual worshipers.&amp;nbsp;Wolf: Normally only intelligent Barbarians can learn such advanced combat tactics as tripping their opponents. The Wolf teaches you those secrets regardless of your mind; what even the smart take aeons (two feats) to master you learn with mere 1000 XP! Later, you learn to follow the tracks of your foes. Woe be you, you lose your sixth sense for enemies and traps, but the wolf warrior’s path makes it all worthwhile!Spiritual Totems [CC]Spirit Bear: The Spirit Bear grants you the Improved Grab ability. Truly wonderful for those interested in Grappling while not interested in turning into actual Bears (why anyone wouldn’t want to be a bear, I have no idea).&amp;nbsp;The Totem Manifestation allows you to rid yourself of the Damage Reduction for effective Improved Toughness [CW] – decent trade if a bit late.&amp;nbsp;Spirit Eagle: The Spirit Eagle gives you keen vision for your speed. Unfortunately, this does not grant you Spot nor Search in class (talk with your DM if interested in this), so you still won’t see a damn thing without DM intervention.&amp;nbsp;The Totem Manifestation is again similarly useless unless your DM allows you to actually learn to see.&amp;nbsp;Spirit Fox: The Fox makes you stealthy. The same problem as with other skill-related things, you’d need to learn to train stealth to truly make this worthwhile. Again, talk with your DM.&amp;nbsp;The Totem Manifestation is actually quite decent; +1 Dodge each time you’d gain DR. For the non-Shocked Barbarians, this is quite an interesting path to pursue.&amp;nbsp;Spirit Lion: The Spirit Lion gives you Pounce in exchange for extra movement. You can now full attack on a charge. You can even pick Whirling Frenzy to enjoy from level 1. Sold!&amp;nbsp;The Totem Manifestation teaches you to roar. You get Strength-based fear-inducing Roar that apparently takes no action (once per day for each point of DR you’d have).&amp;nbsp;Spirit Wolf: The Spirit Wolf teaches you how to best utilize the distraction provided by your allies; you learn to better benefit of flanking your opponents. Handy for those who can rely on allies providing flank; makes for more Power Attack!The Totem Manifestation provides you with Track and some bonuses to Survival. Poor ability that curiously doesn’t improve as your DR would; if you plan on ending your Barbarian progression at level 7 (not that unlikely given that Barbarian PrCs start around this time), it may be worth considering.Alternative Class FeaturesHe is truly wisewho’s traveled farand knows the ways of the world.He who has traveledCan tell what spiritgoverns the men he meets.-Hávámal, The Sayings Of OdinGot class features you don't like? Want to better tailor your Barbarian's abilities to your playstyle? Then you need Alternative Class Features!Ferocity [CS Web]: Rage boosts dexterity and strength instead. -2 penalty to ranged attack rolls outside 30 feet instead of penalty to AC. Sickened instead of fatigued. The kickass part is that you can get ferocious whenever the damn you please; it’s an immediate action to start!Whirling Frenzy [UA]: Rage increases Strength, Ref saves and AC. Allows an extra attack each turn (-2 penalty to all attacks made that turn, including AoOs). Lose Indomitable Will, gain Evasion when raging. Basically, hit things more! Hit things more often! Dodge what’s coming! The only drawback is that you give up your Rage protecting your mind, making you vulnerable to those damn Jedi mind tricks, and that while Whirling, you may not use other kinds of Rages. Alas, but for the straight-classed Barbarians who prefer not getting hit (and hitting others while at it), this is definitely the way to go. Oh, and this is just the thing for Barbarian Archers!Spell Sense [CM]: Trade Trapsense bonus for AC bonus vs. Spells. If you actually have a build with some AC (mayhap a Spirit Fox-worshipping Barbarian Tripper?), this is well worth it. Of course, the primary selling point is that you get rid of Trapsense!Trapkiller [DS]: Trade Trapsense for the ability to detect traps with Survival (!!) and to disarm them by bashing them to bits! Maybe you’re not quite as experienced as the Rogue (-5 to Survival-checks), but you’re damn good at disarming the mechanical ones (and you have the whatchacall’em spell dudettes to disarm the others; you can still find magical traps!).Streetfighter [CS Web]: Gets you rid of the stupid Damage Reduction that never did anyone any good, gives you all kinds of wonderful abilities while charging! TATSUMAKI SENPU KYAKU!Wasteland Trap Sense [Sand]: Rids you of Trap Sense for more useless Trap Sense. Congratulations, bad just got worse!Bonus Feat [Sand]: Lose your Improved Uncanny Dodge, but acquire an Endurance-type feat. Great if one of those is a prerequisite for whatever class you’re looking at. Worthless otherwise.Wasteland Damage Reduction [Sand]: Loses Damage Reduction for a more useless form. Wasteland specializes in making bad worse.Berserker Strength [PHBII]: Lose controlled Rage for uncontrolled Rage. That activates when you’re basically dead. Yea...no.Crafty Hunter [UA]: Lose Rage, gain Archery Combat Style and Favored Enemy. Seeing that what makes Barbarian a good Archer is a Rage-variant...Aquatic Barbarian [Storm]: Lose Fast Movement for improvement in Racial Swim Speed. If you have a racial swim speed, chances are you’re better off taking some of the other variants. Just a suggestion.Roofdweller [CS Web]: So you get two useless feats for Fast Movement. Let me think, no?Planar Barbarian [PlH]: Knowledge (the Planes) in class3rd level: Lose Trap Sense for something equally useless! Congratulations, yet another wasted trade.7th level: Lose Damage Reduction for a more useless form of Damage Reduction! Woot!11th level: Lose Greater Rage for...well, I don’t really care, if you came this far, you did it for Greater Rage.Duskling Barbarian [MoI]:1st level: You lose Fast Movement for speed increases through Incarnum. You have better uses for both, Fast Movement and Essentia.7th level: Lose Damage Reduction, gain Damage Reduction you need to invest essential in. Where’s the vomit smiley when I need one?11th level: Gain extra Essentia while Raging. Actually almost worthwhile! The only problem is that by this point, lack of Essentia shouldn’t really be your primary concern.Fangshield Barbarian (non-Human) [CV]:3rd level: Lose Trapsense and gain the ability to charge longer distances. Anything useful that replaces Trapsense is good in my book! That said, it competes with Trapkiller, Spell Sense and several totems, and it’s enhancement bonus, which sucks.5th level: Lose your Improved Uncanny Dodge, gain the ability to use actually useful version of Awesome Blow – Awesome Charge! Basically, you get to knock people around at the end of a charge. Imagine it combined with Pounce; you can send a whole bunch of them flying in various directions!7th level: Lose the initial Damage Reduction, gain the ability to heal yourself for twice your HD in HP with Rage-uses. Sure, take away my worthless abilities and increase my versatility!\Half-Orc Barbarian [RoD]:2nd level: Lose some stupid dodging abilities, learn to charge more heedlessly. The less AC, the better!5th level: Uh, you get bonuses on Will-saves vs. Illusions. For the uninitiated, Color Spray is ineffective already and to even get a Will-save vs. your average Illusion, you need to interact with it. And uhh...well, just no.7th level: Lose Damage Reduction, two-hand more effectively. Oh mi gosh, it’s useful! Definitely one of the better ways to get rid of DR, although I prefer Street Fighter myself.&amp;nbsp;Goliath Barbarian [RoS]: Knowledge (Nature) in class1st level: Become Large when raging and get more Str! This is the #1 reason to play Goliath!5th level: Get Ex Light Fortifications. As you can never upgrade them, you’re better off just getting an armor with heavies instead.7th level: Get more of a worse kind of Damage Reduction. While slightly better than standard, it’s still too little to bother with; just get something useful instead.CombinationsSo, a few tricks as to how to combine the different options to a devastating/useful effect. Notation (F) = Feat, (S) = skill trick, (A) = alternative class feature:Power Attack (F) + Shock Trooper (F) + Spirit Lion Totem Pounce (A) + Leap Attack (F) + Knockback (F)/Awesome Charge (A)/Knock-Down (F) (+ Twisted Charge (S)/Street Fighter (A) + Nimble Charge (S)): Charge at 1+ opponents. Reduce 1+ opponents to smoldering remains lying within half a dozen feat from you on the ground. Add Cleaving Charge (A) to do it at multiple places in a turn!Intimidating Rage (F) + Imperious Command (F) + Immediate Rage (F)/Ferocity (A) + Never Outnumbered (S): Barbarian Celerity! Show your true face as an immediate action, making everyone within 30’ cower and bask in your glory!Combat Reflexes (F) + Martial Stance: Thicket of Blades (F) + Robilar’s Gambit (F) + Mage Slayer (F) + Stand Still (F)/Improved Trip (F): Make opponent do nothing! Whatever they do, they provoke and if they try to move, you can stop them and if they do anything else, you can hit them hard. Lockdown: Making life miserable for everyone but you since 2006!Track (F) + Trapkiller (A): Make your Survival do everything! Physical traps? Survival. Tracking? Survival. Wilderness movement? Survival. Food? Survival. Whatever else? Roll Survival just in case. It probably works.Weapon Finesse (F) + Shadowblade (F) + Exotic Weapon Proficiency: Spiked Chain (F) + Frantic Rage (F)/Ferocity (A) + Ape-Totem Barbarian (A): Whoever said Kobolds don’t make for good Barbarians? Suddenly you do everything based on Dex and get notable bonuses in the stat from your race and class while being able to dump Str!Mountain Rage (A) + Wolf Berserker (F) + Improved Trip (F): Hurl anything up to Huge size around like they were paper and hit them again for their troubles!Prestige ClassesHEY!

You’ll win at running, sports, weddings, arson, irony, and other things YOU AREN’T EVEN SUPPOSED TO WIN AT!!!WAAAGH!!!CoreHorizon Walker [DMG]: When your options are limited, walking the planes is the best way to expand your abilities. That is the calling of a Horizon Walker; master the environment, master yourself, master the multiverse!&amp;nbsp;Prerequisites: One feat. Endurance. Useless, but it’s just one. Also, you need Knowledge (Geography), not Barbarian’s bread-and-butter, so you should consider spending a brief amount of time as a Ranger to enter in due time.Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, skills, the usual (although better skill list!). Smaller HD. The interesting stuff comes from the terrain masteries. Basic terrain masteries are dull; competence (available everywhere) bonuses to skills, small bonuses to attacks against creatures of certain type with Darkvision and Immunity to Fatigue being the more interesting ones. The truly interesting stuff comes from Planar Masteries, behold:Shifting Mastery: You can Dimension Door once per 1d4 rounds, with a caster level of your character level. For real. Yes, even outside shifting planes! This is truly why the class is worth taking; melee classes really enjoy the mobility this brings to allow you to choose the location where to go about your trip/kill routines!Aligned Mastery: You gain immunity to the adverse effects of being of the wrong alignment on a plane. Handy, not a reason to pick a class. But what’s this? You also gain immunity to aligned spells! This is basically the only means to truly protect yourself from Blasphemy and the like – truly increases your durability against the most fearsome attacks in the game!Cavernous Mastery: You gain Tremorsense 30’. Umm, yea. It’s good.Cold/Fiery Mastery: 20 points of energy resistance to appropriate types? Yes, it’s nice to be practically immune to fire/cold.Verdict: If you’re restricted to only Core-classes, this is the only PrC worth thinking about. It’s pretty comparable to straight Barbarian, although you need to shift your focus from Raging.Completes, Races &amp;amp; PHBIIBear Warrior [CW]: So, you like Rage? Makes you feel good and gives you the high of power! Now, imagine if others could see how damn good you feel. Then Bear Warrior is for you – not only do you become freakishly strong, you’ll be a f*cking bear! That way everyone will know just how fucking awesome you are! This awesome deal bears a closer look:Prerequisites: None! Wait, really? +7 BAB (level 8 entry then), Power Attack (yea, you DO have it), Rage or Frenzy (yes, you DO have it). That means you need absolutely nothing to enter. Nothing at all.Class features: Barbarian skills, saves, bla bla bla bla, nobody cares. The thing you’re looking for is this:Bear form: When raging, a bear warrior can turn into a motherfucking bear!The gist of it: you get fewer uses of Rage (cry me a river, pick Extra Rage) and in exchange, each use of your Rage allows you to RIP THINGS APART. Basically, you get the Rage-modifiers of a level 20 Barbarian on level 8. And you get 3 natural weapons. Character level 13, you become Large and get Improved Grab for good measure. Character level 17, you get +20 Str (and some Dex, Natural Armor and Con). For serial killers and great justice!Now, there is a catch (no, not the “once per day”-thing; errata removes the conflicting statement and you’re only limited by your Rage-uses). You can’t use standard weapons. You do get all your awesome Natural Weapons, but you don’t add 2x Power Attack to the damage. However, since you get 3 Natural Weapons, you’re fine for starters.Later? Pick Improved Unarmed Strike (or better, dip Fist of the Forests) and Multiattack. Do full iterative with your Unarmed Strike and all 3 Natural Weapons as secondaries, all adding full PA (not 2x though) to damage! Enter Shock Trooper and Leap Attack, turning you into a full fledged godless killing machine. So not only do you claw and bite the opponents, you also batter and crush them with your bearliness; the bear knows kung-fu!As a bonus, all your natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered light weapons (and still add PA damage as per Power Attack-description in PHB), so you could use “Snow Tiger Berserker” Lodge-feat from Unapproachable East to gain Pounce, allowing you to retain your Fast Movement for the cost of a feat – worth thinking about! Oh, and then there’s the whole “Yes, you’re a Large creature with disgusting Str and Improved Grab” going on for you! Only you can grapple the Tarrasque and live to tell the tale!Remember to pester your DM about how equipment works with this. Polymorph (the ability this is paralleled to) states that “all equipment the new form could wear stay on you while others meld”, which would suggest that among others, you’d keep any Belts, Cloaks, Bracers, Boots and Amulets. Feel free to argue about armor, gloves and the like – that’s purely between your DM and you. Do know though that Dire Bear is only marginally stronger than Brown Bear; for the aspiring Bears, a strong consideration of whether those 5 levels are really worth it is in order.Verdict: Smokey! (That means “kickass” for those that do not speak Bear)Fist of the Forest [CC]: These “Barbarians” hail from wilderness, hence their name. The Fists of the Forest allow the wilderness to empower them, share its strength with them. Indeed, the Barbarians in the Fists’ ranks are truly the most formidable of their kind! As a bonus, the path is short and mighty – the Barbarians entering the ranks of the Fists need not wait for the fulfillment of their abilities; the nature provides instant gratification, as it should be!How then does it work?Prerequisites: Two feats. Great Fortitude and Improved Unarmed Strike (don’t be tempted to be a Monk, for verily, they lose BAB and enter later). Oh, and the usual Power Attack. Then you need some skills you have in class, and BAB +4. And permission, but ‘cause you’re a Barbarian you practically have it already.Class features: Barbarian BAB and HD, skilled in dodging in addition to withstanding, only 2 skills/level. Only 3 levels long – lots of awesome in a short span! The interesting stuff:Fast Movement: Yeah, you move even faster!Feral Trance: Get in touch with your primal self! Adds to Dex, unarmed damage and teaches you to bite (read: extra attack)! Can specifically be used while Raging!AC bonus: The tougher you get, the harder it is to damage you! You get your CONSTITUTION to AC. Yes. For real. Sure, you can’t wear an armor, but who cares? It’s not like you much cared for armor anyways; it just gets in the way of your being awesome!Unarmed Strike Damage: Three levels give you the damage a Monk needs 8 levels for! Use your fists for everyday tasks like television, or romance, or helicopter repair and maintenance! You even get to hit through DR/Magic, incorporeality and all that with your BARE HANDS!Scent: Yes. For real!All this in 3 levels for the low, low price of two feats and having to sleep out and hunt instead of pretending to be a city dweller (you’re a damn Barbarian, this is a given)! Oh yeah, and you can break these rules three times per month.Verdict: Always! Only three levels and two feats for all kinds of awesome! I heard Fists of the Forests got along well with Bear Warriors. You may wish to try marrying the two.Frenzied Berserker [CW]: Barbarians don’t feel true rage. A true rage enraptures all, encompasses all, endures all! To walk the path of true rage, you must step into the boots of a Frenzied Berserker. Your power will be overwhelming – over nine thousand, infact. The true strength though comes from your ability to channel your hatred; once you let your anger flow through you, your hate will make you strong, and once you do hit it will increase the impact tenfold! That is why you walk this perilous path; so you’ll hit harder than anyone!Prerequisites: Three feats. Cleave (serves you well to speed up gutting the sheep), Destructive Rage (waste of time; with your strength, you need no help in wrecking objects), Intimidating Rage (it helps when you make it work – needs Charisma, otherwise not your cup of tea). Power Attack is on the list too, but it’s basically a class feature. And BAB +6 and Barbarian alignment (again, these don’t count). So, you pay to enter alright.Class features: Barbarian BAB and saves. Only two points per level and crappy list. Sucks. Now on to the good stuff::Diehard: Meh, but bonus feats are always handy.Supreme Cleave: Makes your Cleave better. Why not?! You can take a 5’ step between your Cleave-attack and principal attack – a great way to make the feat more useful (and with the amount of damage you can dish out, it WILL be useful)!Improved/Supreme Power Attack: Now we’re talking! Your principal source of damage…doubled? Yes, for real! First, you get 1.5x bonuses on Berserker level 5 (character level 11), you get the bonuses doubled. Note that errata clarifies it’s 50% and 100% instead of x1.5 and x2; therefore, you get full benefits with a two-handed weapon too!Frenzy: Ah, now this is what the class is all about! Your true hatred! One use per two levels – they’ll add up fast! Also, you can Frenzy while Raging for truly massive bonuses. But what does the Frenzy mean? To start with, you gain +6 Str and an extra attack each round (doesn’t stack with Haste; handy on those levels though!). The price is -4 AC (so you shouldn’t bother with it at all) and 2 points of non-lethal damage per round (mommy, you only have few hundred points of HP). The bigger thing though? You need to make DC20 Will-save to end this Frenzy. Why is that bad? Once the baddies run out, you’ll be attacking your allies (and no, you cannot Iron Heart Surge it away; you need to spend your actions attacking to best of your ability)!You’ll NEED to work around this. Have your casters prepare spells that stop you from wrecking allies. Get a Merciful weapon as your primary weapon of choice. Take Steadfast Determination. Get thrown into an Oytugh Hole. Just make sure your failed Will-save doesn’t end up with a very dead party and a very, very “Do not want!” Berserker. A thing adding to the problem – if you’re dealt damage, you need to succeed a Will-save against 10+damage dealt or start Frenzy. That makes traps, environment and similar hitting you doubly dangerous! Of course, all this isn’t worth +6 damage and an extra attack. However, there is more still.Deathless Frenzy: Berserker level 4, you become immortal! For real. That means if you get knocked for 20000 points of damage, you’ll remain standing…for as long as you Frenzy. Once it runs, you’ll die if you’re not in positives. Still, being immortal is pretty fucking awesome. At least, if you die, that Dragon comes down with you! Since your Frenzy lasts for 3+Con rounds and you can Rage before it for extra Con, you can make it last long enough. This is just awesome!Greater Frenzy: +10 Str, no frills. You don’t need me to tell you this is awesome. Level 8.Inspire Frenzy: The last in the long list of controversial class features; you can make your allies Frenzy! If they’re near you, you can give them Frenzy for 3+Con (YOUR Con) rounds. All allies within 10’. That means if you’re in a tough fight in an AMF with an otherwise caster-party, everyone will suddenly learn to kick ass and chew bubblegum! Now, this means all the normal drawbacks too. So if you run out of opponents before Frenzy runs out (likely), you’ll have a bunch of DC 20 Will-saves or a vast free-for-all melee; beware!Verdict: Gambler’s choice; huge risks, huge rewards for those that find ways to subsume the risks! Just beware; in the end, the house always wins. And your house is the DM!Rage Mage [CW]: Ever been really annoyed by something and just hoped the something would be vaporized? This class tries to make those wishes come true. As an angry magician, you maintain a Barbarian’s abilities while learning to hurl spells empowered by your rage at hapless Gnomes. At least that’s the general idea; how it works in practice deserves a closer look:Prerequisites: One feat in Combat Casting, 2nd-level Arcane Spells, +4 BAB, Rage, Nonlawful alignment. The combination of 2nd-level spells and +4 BAB is a tad difficult.Class features: Medium BAB, inexistent skills, good Fort-saves. Who the hell decided this thing has medium BAB? Anyways, onto the real business:Spell rage: Well, this is obviously what this class is all about. Which is why you’ll be sad to find out that you need to wait 5 levels to be able to use this twice per turn. And 9 for three uses. Basically, you take additional AC penalty, but can cast spells in Rage. Even better, you cast all Evocation, Transmutation, Conjuration, Abjuration and Necromancy-spells on your character level, so your actual caster level hardly matters.Or that’s the idea anyways; being limited to doing this once per day sucks a metric crapton as your abilities outside this spell rage are going to suffer from the classes you’re taking. Since this is a “Rage”, you should be able to Extra Rage it though which fixes the major issue.Overcome Spell Failure: So yea, you can wear a light armor again. Yay?Spells per day: Now, this just sucks. This supposed fighter/mage class gets spells only every other level. Which is about as effective as alternating between Fighter- and Wizard-levels (or to say, not very; they specifically printed Eldritch Knight to help with that).Rage: Extra uses of Rage. Sure, why not.Spell Fury: Having to wait until level 7 to get the first real class feature just sucks. Luckily, this is a good one; free quickening on a spell of level 4 or lower. Really helps with your action economy especially since your casting is like to be a bit lacking. Only once per spellrage though so it alone isn’t enough; you still need something to quicken a spell for the remaining rounds.Tireless Rage: When will your Rage ever run out during an encounter? Yea, this won’t come up.Warrior Cry: You can gain enhancement bonuses to all physicals (which you already have) and full BAB (which you’d have if you weren’t fooling around with this class) once per day as a free action? Woohoo, what a capstone! Basically, this allows you to pretend once per day that you didn’t take Rage Mage.Verdict: Sucks! Now, to be fair, it is possible to build a decent character with Rage Mage. It takes a lot of work and it’s still not amazing, but Spell Fury is the saving grace preventing the class from falling into the “no unique class features”-pit. That said, unless you know you want this specific class and have a very good idea of what you’re doing, stay away and leave this to the professionals.Racial SpecialsEye of Gruumsh [CW]: Orcs are the most populous Barbarians on the planet. That much is known. Therefore, it's no surprise that Orcish Barbarians have their own sects with their own abilities. This is the organization for Orcish barbarians. But do they truly live up to their name of greatest Barbarians in the world? Let's find out!Prerequisites: Two feats, Proficiency and Focus in Orc Double Axe. If your DM isn't a total doofus, he'll give Orcs automatic proficiency anyways, reducing it to one feat (which still sucks). Other than that, you got to be an Orc (duh) or a Half-Orc (don't...just don't). Then you have to get rid of one of your eyes. WTF, right? Apparently it's no problem though. Gotta be Gruumsh Cleric Alignment though; CN, CE, NE. Bad for adventuring, although CN might be doable. +6 BAB.Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, less skills. Usual fare, a small step down.Blind-Fight: So yea, a crappy bonus feat. Congrats! One step closer to Pierce Magical Concealment for surprising those pesky mages though. Also, you can act as if you had both eyes. So much for that ritual, eh?Command the Horde: You can command a bunch of weaker Orcs 30' from you. God help any opposing Orcish force encountering you!Rage: So your Eye of Gruumsh-levels stack with Barbarian for extra Rages. Booooring.Swing Blindly: Now, this is something! More strength, more AC penalty, on level 2! What it basically comes down to is that you hit harder and get hit more! Just the way you like it, especially since everyone automatically hits you anyways!Ritual Scarring: You get some Natural Armor on 3, 6 &amp;amp; 9 to make up for the lost AC above. In reality, nothing happens.Blinding Spittle: What a corny attack! You spit your stomach acid up to 20' away at a creature's eyes. The best part? Your stomach acid is mighty potent! 10+Eye of Gruumsh-level+Con! Smaller DCs have thrown men into despair. Also, it isn't listed to take an action; I suppose that defaults to a standard action, but man, would it be awesome to get it as a free action? Either way, while very limited in times/day, this is an actually useful ability! You start with 2 on level 4 and get it to max of 4 times on level 7.Blindsight: You sense things 5' from you starting from level 5. On level 8, you sense things almost next to you (10'!). Never really big enough to help, but allows you to smack that sneaky thief who forgot to buy Lords of Madness for his idiocy (or should I say, his madness?).Sight of Gruumsh: So basically, you get more power from...seeing when you die! That's right, Orcs wanna die! This gives you morale bonuses to saves and AC. Rather trivial as you're still tanking your AC with your Rage, but hey, whatever right? That said, this is not worth taking all 10 levels for.Verdict: Orcs...could do better. That said, increasing your Strength-bonus when Raging is very good and while the prerequisites are completely pointless (seriously, Orc Double Axe?! What do you expect Barbarians to do, play Darth Maul?), Blinding Spittle is another handy ability. All in all, starts off crappy but turns out actually semi-decent! Probably loses out to straight Barbarian, but not by all that much (and that's mostly because this class gets some pointless AC boosts while tanking its AC further when Raging), mostly on the pointless prerequisites (ask your DM to homebrew a two-handed exotic Orc War Axe with 2d8 damage or something and call it a day).Orc Warlord [RoF]: Alright, so let's say you want to build a horde and go ravage the world. This is the prestige class for you! The Orc Warlord is a 5 level long prestige class focused on increasing the amount of lackeys you can get with the Leadership feat.Prerequisites: Orc or half orc BAB of&amp;nbsp;+5 or higher. Any non-good alignment. Intimidate 8 ranks, Ride 5 ranks, Survival 5 ranks. Leadership and the feats Blood of the Warlord or Might Makes Right. Finally, the rage ability – but of course you have that if you're reading this.Class features: Full BAB, good Fortitude and Will saves, some skills, 2+Int mod skill points per level, yadda yadda. You're not here for that, though the higher Will save is nice.Gather Horde: You can attract 150% the number of followers you would otherwise be able to as a 1st level Orc Warlord. At 3rd, you get 200% more followers! These extra followers must be orcs. And given how Might Makes Right lets you add your Strength bonus to your Leadership score, you will have a lot of followers.Inspire Courage: The surest way to stop your troops from running away from scary things in front of them is to put something even scarier behind them. By speaking (or howling, ranting, etc) for one full round, you can Inspire Courage in your minions. This works similar to the bard's ability (but does not stack with it) with a few differences: you grant a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls, and you can use it while raging! Intriguingly, there are no limits on how many times you may initiate it. The warlord can't cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by command word, but what self-respecting orc would do that sort of thing anyways?Final Rage: The 5th level capstone is the ability to incite rage in yourself and your allies as a free action, even those that have run out of rages or could not otherwise rage. Anyone already in a rage gets upgraded to a greater rage. The rage lasts until the end of the warlord's next turn, and then everyone suffers penalties.Verdict: Leadership shenanigans are always fun. The follower boosting runs out at level 3, though, the Inspire Courage doesn't scale, level 4 is a dead level, and the capstone Final Rage is too brief to do the concept of a howling mad orc horde justice. If you're in a game where you could make use of a large number of followers, you might consider 3 levels in this at most.Battlerager [RoF]: These are also called the &quot;Kuldjargh&quot; or &quot;Axe idiots&quot;, and for a reason. If you remember Thibbledorf Pwent from Salvatore's books...well, this is nothing like him. Still, seeing that Dwarves do have a history for raging, so let's see what their racial &quot;angry class&quot; does:Prerequisites: Two feats, Cleave &amp;amp; Endurance. Not bad, Cleave is handy on its own and Endurance leads to Steadfast Determination. Skills though, you need 8 ranks in Intimidate (ok), 2 ranks in Knowledge: Religion (WTF?) and two ranks in two Performs, including Perform: Singing (WTF?!). Oh, and a non-lawful Dwarf and the ability to rage, but duh.Class features: They get the already-familiar Barbarian BAB, saves, etc. and less skills.Rage: They get an extra use of Rage on first and every two levels thereafter. This is actually good since it's much faster than standard Barbarian progression.Gruff: -4 to all Charisma-based skills and Charisma-checks, except Intimidate to which you get +2 on level 1. If you're making a non-Intimidate Charisma check as a Dwarf Barbarian, something is wrong. This is ok, although due to their racial Charisma-penalty, Dwarves make for some of the worst Intimidator Barbarians in the first place.Rock Gut: +2 to saves vs. poison. So...you still fail only on 1. Nothing new here.Close-Quarter Fighting: On level 2, you can avoid Grapples. The thing is, with your Str and abilities, nothing short of the Tarrasque will be grappling you anyways. At least you get to pretend you're getting class features.Fearless: On level 2, you become immune to fear-effects, +2 Insight to all saves vs. mind-affecting. Useful to a degree! Insight is an obscure bonus-type to saves too!Improved Unarmed Strike: Yawn. This is only a prerequisite. Level 3, btw. I suppose it helps enter some other classes, but it's not worth hammering your head to a wall for 3 levelsGreat Cleave: Yawn. Sometimes randomly useful. If only you were naturally Large, not some pesky Dwarf... Level 4 too.Reckless Offensive: Yawn. I guess it's a free bonus. This is the same feat as the &quot;Reckless Offense&quot;-feat in SRD, except with a bit higher prerequisites. Likewise, level 4.Natural Armor: +2 hardly makes up for all the penalties you'll be taking. Whatever... And this is all you get on level 5.Verdict: Dwarves could do a lot better. Basically, you get +2 Intimidate, immunity to Fear (available as a feat) and a bunch of worthless or random feats. In fact, this class is little more than a CW Samurai in disguise; you get a bunch of poor, pre-determined feats and that's about it. This is basically a test to see if giving a ton of sitiuational/weak/worthless feats in few levels somehow made said feats less worthless. Protip: It doesn't. Stay away. Oh yeah, and it's 3.0.Deepwarden [RoS]: Want to be a really hard guy? Like, Stonecold? If so, this is for you. Be the man...or dwarf of stone! Everything Battlerager should've been is right here. Toughness, simple kickass toughness and the feel of a Dwarf. A look at dwarfdom:Prerequisites: Endurance as the only feat - reasonable, especially with Steadfast Determination. Heal, Climb, Jump, Knowledge (Dungeoneering) &amp;amp; Survival 5 ranks. Heal and Knowledge cause trouble here; Barbarian has neither in class pushing entry to level 7 unless doing something about it – a 1-level dip in Ranger will do. 3 levels might be better for free Endurance though. BAB +5.Class features: Barbarian BAB &amp;amp; Fort, good Will and 6+Int skills with a great list. Far superior to a Barbarian here.Track: Free bonus, why not? Adds to your Survival-based abilities; combine with Trapkiller for real Survival-focus.Trap Sense: Yawn.Stone Warden: This is the reason to take Deepwarden. You get Con to AC over Dex! It's been clarified in FAQ that this is capped by armor's maximum bonus (RAW disagrees). However, there's an incredibly simple way around that: be unarmored! Pick up levels in Fist of the Forests to get Con to AC again! Since this replaces Dex, the two should stack just fine. Heck, pick a Monk's Belt for Wis to AC to boot! Then just enter classes that raise your Con skyhigh and enjoy your Way Higher Than Yours AC. The fact that this is available on level 2 makes this class best as a two-level dip (along with the good Will-saves). That said, the rest isn't horrible either; read on!Animal Messenger: Free spell-likes never hurt. Good for delivering messages and so on. Small benefit though, and only thing you get on level 3.Uncanny Dodge: Well, since you traded the original for something more useful, here's your chance to pick it up again! Two levels for this is a bit much, but hey, you're getting a ton of skills, important good saves and all that so it's not all that bad.Stubborn Mind: With your Will, this extra insurance against domination could actually be useful! That said, you shouldn't plan on getting dominated often enough to make this good. Level 5 is still reasonable.Sending: Actually a decent spell for communication and all that. No combat use, obviously, but it has obvious utility. Again, only class feature for level 6.Swift Tracker: Well, I suppose you might as well... Helps with your speed since Dwarves aren't naturally too fast trackers. Level 7 is really high though, seeing how little the class gives at this point.Improved Uncanny Dodge: You still stick it to Rogues, except worse since this only counts your Deepwarden class level. If you got it as a Barb though, this is all good. As a painful note, this is level 8...Greater Animal Messenger: Meh, at this point the benefits really aren't matching up to the cost.Verdict: This does it right. You get the huge defensive boost on level 2 and can afford some levels around that point. Two-level dip is great and you can afford up to 7 levels for the skills. It gets really hairy as the gains keep getting worse by the level. Still, the two-level dip is an obvious choice for most Dwarf Barbarians, especially in combination with Fist of the Forests to make the ability actually useful, and more Rage-versions that increase Con. Then you have Con to HP, Fort, Will (Steadfast) and AC twice. And thanks to Rage, your attacks will be very ok too.Other SourcesFrostrager [Frost]: In this universe, there's only one absolute... everything freezes! This class is for those who want to have cold, living hands. You have a soul of ice and you die to pour it on others! A mere Barbarian is hardy, but you are the winter itself, the icy, biting chill and the unstoppable advance! A closer look at the specifics of this frozen path of ruin:&amp;nbsp;Prerequisites: Two feats. Oh, and Power Attack. But you know the drill by now. Frozen Berserker is a mediocre feat and Improved Unarmed Strike is Improved Unarmed Strike. Oh, and you need some Intimidate, Survival and you need to almost die of cold. So nothing major. BAB +7&amp;nbsp;Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, a bit fewer skills from an anemic list. Now, the things that make you a Frostrager...Frostrage: You become a chunk of ice when Raging! More specifically, you get a natural armor, you hit harder and and your hands deal cold damage. If you already have a bigger unarmed damage die, this should probably advance that. Check with your worldmaking slave to be sure. This is what the class is all about anyways. Do realize that cold resistance is only second to fire in commonness though so don't rely too much on the cold damage. It goes two ways though: just walk around in Energy Immunity: Fire and you've got resistance/immunity to the two most common energy types in the game!Freezing Blood: So your blood is so cold it freezes if you were to bleed. Nothing major, but doesn't hurt one bit. All bonus! Apparently, you can manage with a bit slower blood circulation; I suppose your Rage evens the blood pressure out! Free level 1 bonuses never hurt.One-Two Punch: An extra attack. What's not to like? Oh yeah, the -2 penalty. But the thing is, since you're a Barbarian, you actually have the attack bonus to hit regardless. Great! And low level too.Absorb Cold: So you can have the Big Stupid Blaster target you and the enemy horde hopelessly hacking away at you with a cold-substituted generic Boom. Also, cold planes rock, 'cause apparently you absorb the lack of heat or something and heal. Whatever, I'll take what I'm given! You'll get it in the passing.Improved Frostrage: So your fists keep growing! Congratulations. Now, if this stacks with Fist of the Forests, you'll actually be looking at 2d8 fists! Oh, and the cold damage you deal increases.Rend: If you hit a dude twice, you get a third one for free! Nothing major, but no reason to turn down free damage! Of course, it's all you get on the last level so think carefully if you really want it all that much; it doesn't get PA bonus.Verdict: For the really, really cool dudes! Not best evar, but definitely not a waste of space either. As a northener myself, I approve.Runescarred Berserker [UE]: The best way to defeat Magic is through Magic, or, failing that, through negating Magic. If this is the path you choose, Runescarred Berserker is for you. You grow as a Barbarian, but learn to weave Magic through your Rage! In a world without magic the Barbarians rule supreme – the Runescarred make that world! This truly demands a closer look:Prerequisites: Three feats. Iron Will (handy), Survivor (sucks), Berserker Lodge Feat (includes quite a few good options, covered in the feat section). Also, a bunch of pointless skills and Intimidate, but you can afford them. BAB +7 and hail from Rashemen. Rough, but it gets better!Class features: Barbarian BAB, saves, skills, you know this crap. Additionally, this progresses most your Barbarian class features, granting you Damage Reduction, Extra Rage, Greater Rage. You also get Energy Resistance 5: Frost and some Natural Armor. Again, this is not what the class is about though. No, a Runescarred Berserker is defined by his runescars!Runescar: You can scribe a runescar on your body. You get a spell list to go with it, including such doozies as Heal, Air Walk, Anti-Magic Field, Restoration, Spell Immunity, True Strike, basic buffs and so on! You pick one to learn each level, then scribe a runescar on your body (costs a bit and deals damage that you can just heal afterwards) and then you can use it like a Potion! So, what makes this so awesome? Why, Anti-Magic Field of course! As said before, nothing beats a Barbarian without Magic and the ability to cast Anti-Magic Field gives YOU the tools to strip your opponents of their magical abilities. Have extraordinary means of flight and you’ll truly be the one-man wrecking crew – the bane of the fools relying on magic and their supernatural abilities! Of course, you’ll have to reach them first, but that can be arranged.Verdict: YES! THIS is how a Barbarian plays into his strengths! Slay the Wizard, save the world!Black Blood Cultist [CoR]: Do you want natural weapons, but still be a humanoid? Do you want to grapple people to death and then savage their souls? Do you want to truly be an incomparable wrestler? If so, this is for you. Don't be mislead by the name; all this PrC does is give you superb grappling abilities!Prerequisites: Two feats, Improved Unarmed Strike and Track. 8 ranks in Survival, 2 in Knowledge (Nature), Rage and Chaotic Neutral, Chaotic Evil or Neutral Evil alignment. Not too bad; those are easily attainable as bonus feats anyways.Class features: Barbarian skills, good Fort &amp;amp; Ref, but only medium BAB. You'll have to find other Grapple-bonuses for that. That said, the class features help out a lot:Feral Rage (Claws): You stack these levels for Rage-uses. All good. On level 1, you also get Claw-attacks. 1d6 damage, no less. Really nice; two primary Natural Weapons.Damage Reduction: On level 1, it's 1/Silver. Pretty useless, but it may come up. On level 4 it's 3/silver and level 9 5/silver. The last one is almost never worth it due to the lost point of BAB, but the 3/silver is pretty much free and can be useful against Natural Attack- or Archery-focused characters. Pretty weak, but can randomally help.Improved Grapple: Free bonus feat. All fine.Feral Rage (Bite): A third natural attack. It's secondary, but it's still an extra attack so it's all good.Scent: Sure, why not. It can help you in a surprising number of circumstances and it's a free part of the progression on 4.Stranglehold: Move Action Coup de Grace; handy for when you're in a hurry or have stunned guys that need a-killin'. Even better if you have Boots of Battle Charger allowing you to use the standard action for a pouncing Charge. Not that useful that often, but it can definitely have its moments.Feral Rage (Rend): More Natural Attack-damage never hurt anyone, except the opponent. Good for the level.Improved Natural Attacks: See above. May stack with the Improved Natural Attack-feat as this isn't defined as a size increase and has a different name and mechanic (applies to all attacks).Savage Grapple: This is why you take the class. Suddenly, your successful Grapple-checks downright destroy anything you're fighting, allowing you to easily drop anything in one round (Pouncing charge with Grab &amp;amp; Damage-attempts for iteratives should drop just about anything you can Grapple in the first place).This is also level 8, which means you still haven't lost the third point of BAB. You aren't going to either, so this is probably where you should bail out. Do note that Freedom of Movement is going to be ruining your day on these levels a lot, but that's just more of a reason to Anti-Magic it up. Few creatures want to be in Grapple with you, and those are Colossal so you can't Grab them anyways.Feral Form: You need a really good reason to fight without Rage on these levels. This just shouldn't come up nearly often enough to matter. It costs you two levels and an extra point of BAB; the cost is simply too high.Verdict: Fun with tentacles! It's obvious what Black Blood Cultist does: Grapple. And oh boy, does it ever Grapple well! Savage Grapple is the single most brutal attack you can do in Grapple and will result in really quick death whatever you're grappling. You'll need some manner of Anti-Magic to negate opponents' Freedom of Movement, and some manner of size increases to engage Larger-Than-Huge creatures, but if you want a grappler, you're unlike to do better than this at least as far as damage goes. Do note that Black Blood Cultist improves your damage, but is rather poor as far as your Grapple-checks go so couple it with something to help on that front (of course, as you're a Barbarian, you'll still do.)Primeval [Frost]: Barbarian ways date back to the dawn of time. Sometimes, a Barbarian may feel the need to dial back into day 1. That Barbarian is walking the path of a Primeval. Their strength as vast as the time before them, a Primeval is truly something to be feared. However, becoming one is not easy. Indeed, a great cost is required for a great gain.Prerequisites: Three worthless feats: Self-Sufficient, Toughness, Endurance. Further, two worthless skills in Knowledge (Nature) and Handle Animal, only accompanied by Survival. Mere 5 ranks though. Finally, BAB +8; level 9 is the earliest possible entry. It is not easy being a Primeval, but the Bear Totem gets you Toughness, while Ranger levels net you Endurance, which means if you are smart, you only have to waste one feat on Self-Sufficient.Class features: Barbarian BAB and saves, less skills - the usual story. To business:Primeval Form: This is what the class is all about; an alternative, prehistoric form you can assume like the Bear Warrior assumes that of a Bear. This is mono-form, and thus you must choose a single form and ride it to the end. Remember that instead of gaining the form's ability scores, the form's modifiers are applied as a bonus to your stats. There could be no better news for a Barbarian! Your massive Strength and Con grow ever more massive. This is truly something amazing.Allow me to suggest anything with a large array of natural attacks. Giant Octopus, for example, makes for a fine choice. The more, the merrier! All your abilities are amplified by the number of natural attacks you have. Extra uses come on levels 4, 7 and 10 and are badly needed. It is worth inquiring if the &quot;Extra Wildshape&quot;-feat would give you extra uses of Primeval Form; Wildshape is listed as being able to mimic Primeval Form, but you lack Wildshape so you don't qualify for the feat without help from above.&amp;nbsp;Animal Empathy: You gain some trivial bonuses when meddling with animals of the type you change into. I know not of you, but it does sound horribly boring to me. Free extra ability never hurt anyone though.Regression: You begin the return to your roots, losing intellect and force of will, while empowering your body. Indeed, you become more and more animal-like, the further you walk this path. Worry not, that's why you're here. Levels 2, 5 and 8 each see a change.Low-Light Vision: Having the ability in any form is always useful, when it comes as a bonus.Feral Power: Now we are talking! Your physique reaches a new level, and you gain global bonuses to physical stats and armor. And the change continues! You accumulate these bonuses three times, making you vastly more powerful than standard version of your alter ego creature!Scent: Like anything feral, your auxiliary senses grow keener and you notice things before unsmelled. This is half-way through your regression, on level 5.Fast Movement: As your physique develops, so does your speed. Once you reach 8th level, you gain a boost to movement. It's always good to have.Primeval Shapeshifter: Alas, your last ability is not amazing. You become one with your animal spirit. Unfortunately, that means giving up the powers making it worthwhile to be a Humanoid in the first place; magic such as Enlarge Person can no longer be cast upon you. You also gain a worthless Damage Reduction as it's pierced by magic - every creature either has ability to pierce it with their natural weapons, or access to magical weapons. Either way, this is not worthwhile.Verdict: Great power, great price! You pay a dear price to enter and the hour is late. However, the abilities you gain are quite wonderful. Your strength grows immensely and you can acquire a form of larger size, power and more attacks. The only turkey about this class is the 10th level. The costs are a bit high, but for those willing to pay, you'll feel strength you haven't experienced in millennia! If only Primeval weren't completely magical in nature...Totem Rager [MoI]: The primal ways of a Barbarian go hand-in-hand with the natural soul energy wielded by the Totemist. Where these two meet, a Totem Rager is born; the primal might of a Barbarian combined with the magical soulmelding of Totemist makes for some of the greatest warrior to ever have graced the planet with their presence. This is suited for those who have mastered manipulation of Incarnum. For those still learning, I suggest you start your studies here. With that said, let us see the deal here:Prerequisites: One feat, Cobalt Rage. 5 ranks in Intimidate, 9 in Survival. The ability to bind soulmelds to Totem-chakra, Rage. Everything you would have anyways, so nothing of relevance.Class features: Medium BAB, d10 HD, Good Ref &amp;amp; Fort, Barbarian skills. A Barbarian he isn’t.Meldshaping: 8 levels out of 10 advance your meldshaping abilities. As the first level is void, it is in your best interest to take as many as you can. A very fair deal in its entirety.Totem Rage: When raging, gain extra essential equal to half your Totem Rager level. Free bonuses, what’s not to love?Wild Empathy: Free bonuses never hurt anyone. Minor thing, but no need to complain, it’s still free.Extra Rage: 2nd level grants you an extra use of rage. As a Barbarian, you surely can appreciate the value.Damage Reduction: This is just as worthless as it is for a Barbarian as it comes in no greater quantities. Mayhap ask for one of Barbarian’s replacement options instead. That said, this is not why you’re taking the class so free bonuses again never hurt anyone.Chakra Binds: It’s necessary to your advancement as a meldshaper to acquire the remaining chakras. Thankfully you get them in reasonable schedule, on 4th and 9th level respectively..Extended Rage: Your Cobalt Rage now also extends the duration of your Rage. Not worth much, but at least you can be certain you can withstand the entire battle.Totem Chakra Bind: These improvements are necessary for you as a Totemist. Thankfully this is included in the class progression. As a capstone though, this is far away. Still, it’s very much worthwhile.Verdict: Depends. The value of the class is entirely dependant on what you do with your Meldshaping. With all the natural weapons and strength-check/damage bonuses it provides, there are many ways to make for truly brutal Totem Ragers. But again, all that depends on your proficiency with Incarnum; the Rage-abilities are merely an afterthought. This is principally a class for Totemists who want some strength and the free Pounce.Champion of Gwynharwyf [BoED]: Just walking the road of a Barbarian does not mean abandoning your deities. On the contrary, the life of strife can bring you closer to your deity than a life of service ever could. Champions are Barbarians elevated by their deities to be their champions and fight in the forefront of the battle of deities manifesting itself on the material world once again. Such is certainly worth something. Let us scan the costs:Prerequisites: Two feats; Knight of Stars and Righteous Wrath. 9 ranks in Intimidate, and BAB +6. Hefty entry price, but mayhap there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Chaotic Good alignment is likewise required.Class features: Barbarian saves, skills, HD, BAB and everything else. This is all too familiar for us already. To the more unique part:Detect Evil: Like a Paladin, you can detect the presence of evil creatures. This will help you in your struggle for a better world.Rage: You continue to advance as if a Barbarian. Most excellent.Smite Evil: Like a Paladin, you learn to imbue a strike per day with divine energy dealing grievous wounds to the wicked. You gain only few uses overall, maxing out at 3 on level 9. As this is Charisma-based, you’re unlike to make much use of it anyways, although the extra damage is always worthwhile. Nevertheless, this is a minor ability and should be treated as such.Spells: Now this is a reason to choose the path of a divine champion; you learn to cast a small number of divine spells to better thwart the evil Wizards’ magic and to hit them in the head even harder! This is Wisdom-based, which is definitely doable as Wisdom is already useful anyways and you only need 14 for your highest level magic. Their magic protects and enhances their combat ability, so you must still do the attacking, but your god can empower your strikes.Furious Casting: This is what the class is all about; in spite of the Rage, you can use magic! Truly wonderful ability, and granted on level two.Divine Grace: Like a Paladin, you can use your Force of Will to protect you from harmful magic. Unless you use the Battle Blessing [CC] feat to cast based on Charisma though, you’re unlike to have enough for relevant bonuses. As a bonus though, Charisma-focused Champion makes for a mighty intimidator too.Damage Reduction: Over the span of 10 levels, you get 5/- DR. This is actually a bit better than the standard Barbarian-ability and can be sometimes helpful due to the relatively fast progression. Don’t rely on this to keep you alive though.Resist Enhancement: Further defenses for your mind; it never hurts to be more secure against enhancements. This is on character level 9 too so you get it way before it becomes trivial.Fearsome Fury: This adds perfectly to the Intimidate-combo! You get an effective extra Intimidate vs. everyone! Imperious Command it up and you have a bunch of opponents most definitely cowering in your feet! Truly an ability worth taking the class for.Energy Resistance: So yes, you get a resistance to an energy type on 5 and it improves on 10. Free bonuses never hurt anyone.Immune to Charm and Compulsion: Free immunities never hurt anyone.Verdict: Yes! For a charismatic Barbarian, or one interested in spellcasting, this is a wonderful class. Nobody else would even be interested, so in short, this rocks! Although more than 8 levels is probably a waste.PossessionsWeaponsThe secret of steel has always carried with it a mystery. You must learn its riddle. You must learn its discipline. For no one - no one in this world can you trust. Not men, not women, not beasts.

I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you, will remember if we were good men or bad. Why we fought, or why we died. All that matters is that two stood against many. That's what's important! Valor pleases you, Crom... so grant me one request. Grant me revenge! And if you do not listen, then to HELL with you!-Conan the CimmerianIn battle: You must charge in and hit things hard with your legendary Barbarian Rage. Then stand still and hit things hard. Intimidate people and/or trip them if you are a control type of Barbarian. Try to protect the squishies so they can rain doom upon your enemies and whatnot.However, you must never grapple something larger than you that has any combination of the following: fangs, claws, horns, spikes, tentacles, genitacles, poisonous secretions, negative energy auras, and molecular disintegration fields.Leave that for the monks.Scouting: Growing up in the wilderness and having been raised by wolves and all has made you as sneaky as the best city thief. Use your legendary Barbarian Stealth to your advantage; reconnoiter ahead of the party, sneak around, track enemies, and keep an ear out for danger. Show that rogue how a real man scouts!Social skills: This is where barbarians really shine; not only do they get Intimidate as a class skill, but they have the huge, bulging muscles to give it a massive circumstance bonus. In addition, diplomacy towards female characters becomes much easier, thanks to your legendary Barbarian Sex Appeal. (May work on the men, too, depending on the kind of Barbarian you play.)Enemies and Rivals&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The greatest pleasure in life is to crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women.-Conan the CimmerianDon’t you mean to say: The greatest pleasure is to vanquish your enemies and chase them before you, to rob them of their wealth and see those dear to them bathed in tears, to ride their horses and clasp to your bosom their wives and daughters?-Genghis Khan… I’ll be back.-Conan the TerminatorAll that is natural - whether strength of arms, or strength of magic - flows from nature.&amp;nbsp; The druid, the sorcerer, the ranger, and even the bard each pull magic from life.&amp;nbsp; They can be commended. The cleric and the paladin both pull magic from the heavens.&amp;nbsp; Be wary, for though gods may be both good and evil, all are fickle and prone to wrath. Even so, there can be much good in this too, for has not Kord benefited his children for untold millennia?But the wizard… it is the wizard that seeks to grasp the mysteries of the world and tear them asunder. It is the wizard that manipulates nations and the fates of thousands in mad grasps for power. Be wary of any who would impose their will above the will of the land. Nature will exist.&amp;nbsp; Any who defy it will eventually be destroyed by it. The strongest buildings, empires, and monuments are swallowed by forest in time. No, trust not in false promises from those who do not follow nature's order. They are to be destroyed.Some may say that another guide for beating mages exists, that a monk has beaten me to the punch. Read on, and I am confident that you will see the light - that at the end of the day, it is cold steel that will do the slaying, not wimpy slapping about. The Barbarian shall be the mage’s bane, and the monk who claims that he is up to the task is merely experiencing delusions of competence. Inept in fighting and inferior in sneaking, only thing the monk can do better than the Barbarian is moving faster, an ability that the Barbarian doesn’t even need as he won’t be running away in shame nearly as often.Well, that’s not entirely true. The monk can also fall slowly, resist mundane diseases, heal himself slightly, stun people by blowing, kill someone instantly with acupuncture once a week, and talk to Pocahontas and all her little woodland friends.The staunch Barbarian can easily match the monk in these fields by taking the damage like a man, drinking orange juice, raging, hitting people with the axe, hitting people harder with the axe, and seducing Pocahontas over a barbeque of woodland friends, respectively.“My answer to the accusations of the monk’s effectiveness is below:No, it's not possible. Are you ****ing kidding me? Even if you use all of the above advice (which was half thrown together by me so I could type THIS, so maybe you'd better look somewhere else anyways) and get 40 point buy, the Barbarian is still going to take a paddle to you and all you're going to get out of the encounter is humiliation and a red butt!”-Vael, the Optimized Monk GuideBeating up BatmanTo those naysayers who are so pessimistic about beating wizards, if they don’t have the guts to try, I call them girlie men!-Conan the RepublicanIt is not enough that I should succeed – all others must fail!-Genghis KhanKHAAAAAAN!!!-Conan the Chronically UpstagedThere has long been a misconception among the ‘civilized’ that barbarians only know how to smash things (and people). However, they fail to realize the enormous wizard-killing potential inherent in the Barbarian.Not only is the Barbarian tough enough to survive the wizard’s evocation attacks, but he also has enough fortitude to shrug off many critical spells that target the body. He is also protected against those enchantments that rely on strength of will to work due to his steadfast determination.Even the much vaunted battlefield control spells are less of an obstacle for the Barbarian, for he can quickly bypass them with his faster movement speed, jump over them as part of a charge, or if indoors, smash through walls in order to create a new route to his enemy.When charging, a Barbarian can deal enough damage to one-shot even the mightiest of mages. What’s more, due to Barbarian’s natural stealthiness, the wizard will literally never see it coming. It is for no small reason that the fearsome Lion Totem Charge-Pounce Surprise is commonly known as the Barbarian Sneak Attack.The weaker wizards are the easiest to handle with this tactic, as you might expect. One solid strike will often take them out, especially if you target their weak points for massive damage. Wrestling them also works, as they won’t be able to cast spells while grappled, leaving you free to administer the legendary Barbarian Atomic Wedgie.More experienced wizards require greater cunning to take down, as they will often be Shape Change Astral Projection Ghost Form Displacement Greater Blinking Contingency Celerity Overland Flight Foresighted. One should be careful to avoid direct combat with such powerful wizard at the beginning, instead, perhaps distracting him with expendables. Convincing a bunch of Antimagic Field endowed monks to take him on for you, for example, would be an excellent way of forcing the caster to waste his resources before you had to fight him.Obviously monks are unable to fly, so they will have difficulty reaching a flying and invisible wizard. Your best bet is to pinpoint the wizard by listening carefully and then fling the monk at that general area. This is a surprisingly effective tactic, as the Barbarian can punt a monk further than the monk can run.When the wizard enters the antimagic field, his spells will vanish, causing him to appear and drop to the ground. The flying monk will also get a chance to grapple the wizard in passing, and allowing him to perhaps accomplish one useful thing. The other monks may pull out their wands of Dispel Magic and try to divest the wizard of his many protective spells. Eventually, one of them is bound to succeed.Whatever the tactic, the eventual goal is to bring down the caster somehow, preferably with the maximum number of casualties among the monks. After the wizard has been worn down, a simple charge attack is all that is needed to finish him. Even if the wizard is tough enough to deal with the sheer amount of punishment you can dish out, he will still have to contend with the Barbarian’s save or die effect: death from massive damage. This is something that he is unlikely to pass with his weak fortitude save, and what’s more, this save or die can be triggered each round at higher levels, instead of once per week.Of course, to take this strategy one step further, one could simply convince two wizards to fight each other by sneaking into one’s tower, defacing the interior, and blaming it on the other wizard, thus ensuring that a feud will develop. Alternatively, a band of adventurers can always be hired at the nearest drinking establishment to troubleshoot a particularly bothersome mage.If all else fails, keep in mind that the wizard's effectiveness is limited to a large extent by the DM; many of the wizard's more powerful spells, ie, Planar Binding or Wish, rely on ambiguous rules interpretation. This is a weak point, as it is therefore subject to DM discretion, unlike partially charged wands and masterwork tools of UMD whose rules are laid down clearly. You can convince the DM to rule in favor of less powerful spells, which will result in less powerful – and more easily killed – wizards.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Update #5] Paladin’s Handbook - Fist of Raziel</title><link href="https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/update-5-paladins-handbook-fist-of.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title=" [Update #5] Paladin's Handbook - Fist of Raziel" /><published>2017-11-25T14:38:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-11-25T14:38:00+02:00</updated><id>https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/update-5-paladins-handbook-fist-of</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/update-5-paladins-handbook-fist-of.html">&lt;h3&gt;Fist of Raziel&lt;/h3&gt;Hello everyone and happy new year! I wish that you all have a healthy 2013 with lots of energy in order to play your favorite roleplaying games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year's first update will be to the Paladin's Handbook and it will focus on a powerful prestige class from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786931361/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=dictmortshand-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0786931361&quot;&gt;Book of Exalted Deeds&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Fist of Raziel&lt;/i&gt;.

The main features are that your&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Smite Evil&lt;/i&gt; ability is greatly enhanced and that in general your paladin chassis (full base attack, good fortitude saves and spells per day) is retained. The class has a strong martial (and since it focuses of&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Smite Evil&lt;/i&gt;, melee martial) feeling and should be perfect for a paladin looking to specialize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Requirements:&lt;/b&gt; Fist of Raziel is generally a very easy prestige class to qualify for.

What makes things worse is that you have to use it before you roll, not after. Having to spend a feat slot may be unfortunate, but thankfully the prestige makes up for your loss. Another requirement that you should be aware of is that you have to be able to cast the spell &lt;i&gt;Divine Favor&lt;/i&gt;; this should normally be no problem, but your build cannot utilize those alternative class features that trade the Paladin's spellcasting abilities for other bonuses. The other requirements are minor and should not be of any concern - Lawful Good, +6 Base Attack, 5 ranks in Knowledge(Religion) and Diplomacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class Skills:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;There are no surprises there - the only significant change is that you get&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Knowledge(The Planes)&lt;/i&gt; as a class skill, so make sure that you at least spend a couple of points there. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Handle Animal&lt;/i&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Ride&lt;/i&gt; skills do not appear in Fist of Raziel's class skill list, so, if you plan on making a character that rides his companion to battle plan accordingly and spend enough points between the two skills in order to be able to make most of the maneuvers listed in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Ride&lt;/i&gt; skill without breaking a sweat. Alternatively, you can use an alternative class feature and get rid of your companion, since the prestige class does not increases its power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class Features:&lt;/b&gt; Fist of Raziel's class features can be summed down to&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Magic Circle, Smite Enhancing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Bonus Feats&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Magic Circle&lt;/i&gt; is a very good feature and one of the greatest assets that the class provides; your natural enemies (being Lawful Good) are evil creatures and you're giving your teammates some numerical bonuses to armor class and saving throws if they stay close to you; regardless of your enemies' alignment, a &lt;i&gt;Magic Circle against Evil &lt;/i&gt;protects from summoned monsters and mind control.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Smite Enhancing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;class features include stacking your paladin class level with fist of raziel levels to determine your smite bonus and also enhancing your&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Smite Evil&lt;/i&gt; abilities with additional benefits (good-aligned, automatically confirm critical hits, gain the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Holy&lt;/i&gt; weapon enhancement and deal additional damage to evil enemies).&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Bonus Feats&lt;/i&gt; are&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sanctify Martial Strike&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Holy Martial Strike&lt;/i&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sunder Evil Item&lt;/i&gt;; only the first is an actual feat in reality -&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sanctify Martial Strike&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;is a weird choice, since you need to actually have picked up&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Weapon Focus&lt;/i&gt; in order to benefit from it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sunder Evil Item&lt;/i&gt; is one of those abilities that I don't like: from a roleplaying perspective, a Lawful Good servant of the heavens would feel the urge to sunder those items and render them to bits and would not consider selling them for profit; however, the optimization perspective generally frowns upon sundering equipment, especially when dealing with expensive, magical enhanced stuff. Finally,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Holy Martial Strike&lt;/i&gt; is a very good capstone ability, giving any weapon you wield the &lt;i&gt;Holy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;enhancement, but does not have synergy with the class's own bonus feat,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sanctify Martial Strike&lt;/i&gt;. That is not that much of a loss, since you most probably have to pick up&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Weapon Focus&lt;/i&gt; before you're able to use it, but you do flush another feat down the toilet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Build Ideas:&lt;/b&gt; Use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Charging Smite&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;paladin variant.

Alternatively, you can use an alternative class feature and get rid of your companion, since the prestige class does not increases its power.Class Features: Fist of Raziel's class features can be summed down to&amp;nbsp;Magic Circle, Smite Enhancing&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Bonus Feats.&amp;nbsp;Magic Circle is a very good feature and one of the greatest assets that the class provides; your natural enemies (being Lawful Good) are evil creatures and you're giving your teammates some numerical bonuses to armor class and saving throws if they stay close to you; regardless of your enemies' alignment, a Magic Circle against Evil protects from summoned monsters and mind control.&amp;nbsp;Smite Enhancing&amp;nbsp;class features include stacking your paladin class level with fist of raziel levels to determine your smite bonus and also enhancing your&amp;nbsp;Smite Evil abilities with additional benefits (good-aligned, automatically confirm critical hits, gain the&amp;nbsp;Holy weapon enhancement and deal additional damage to evil enemies).&amp;nbsp;Bonus Feats are&amp;nbsp;Sanctify Martial Strike,&amp;nbsp;Holy Martial Strike and&amp;nbsp;Sunder Evil Item; only the first is an actual feat in reality -&amp;nbsp;Sanctify Martial Strike&amp;nbsp;is a weird choice, since you need to actually have picked up&amp;nbsp;Weapon Focus in order to benefit from it.&amp;nbsp;Sunder Evil Item is one of those abilities that I don't like: from a roleplaying perspective, a Lawful Good servant of the heavens would feel the urge to sunder those items and render them to bits and would not consider selling them for profit; however, the optimization perspective generally frowns upon sundering equipment, especially when dealing with expensive, magical enhanced stuff. Finally,&amp;nbsp;Holy Martial Strike is a very good capstone ability, giving any weapon you wield the Holy&amp;nbsp;enhancement, but does not have synergy with the class's own bonus feat,&amp;nbsp;Sanctify Martial Strike. That is not that much of a loss, since you most probably have to pick up&amp;nbsp;Weapon Focus before you're able to use it, but you do flush another feat down the toilet. Build Ideas: Use the&amp;nbsp;Charging Smite&amp;nbsp;paladin variant. If you want to have higher spell levels, you can even do something like Paladin 6/Fist of Raziel 1/Divine Crusader 2/Fist of Raziel +9 (increasing divine crusader's spells).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">[Update #5] Familiars’ Handbook - Deliver Touch Spells</title><link href="https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/update-5-familiars-handbook-deliver.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title=" [Update #5] Familiars' Handbook - Deliver Touch Spells" /><published>2017-11-25T14:38:00+02:00</published><updated>2017-11-25T14:38:00+02:00</updated><id>https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/update-5-familiars-handbook-deliver</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dictummortum.github.io/2017/11/25/update-5-familiars-handbook-deliver.html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Deliver Touch Spells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar&amp;nbsp;can deliver touch spells for him.

Try not to mix melee range touch spells with spells that require ranged touch attacks, like ray spells; your familiar can only deliver range:touch spells and not rays.

However, beefy familiars with high strength ratings, although they exist, they are not always what you are looking for; familiars with the &lt;i&gt;Weapon Finesse&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;feat and really high dexterity ratings are more common that you'd think and some of the best familiars already have both.

Holding the charge is also a very good option if you want to have quick buffs on the first round of battle - you cast a touch range spell and let your familiar to hold the charge indefinitely, until you get into trouble; then it touches you, releasing the spell energy and you're free to act normally. Of course, this method has its flaws (if you cast any other spell, the touch spell dissipates), but there are some workarounds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Metaspells to be used with the 'Deliver Touch Spells' ability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spectral Hand&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a oftenly used wizard spell, in order to deliver your touch spells from a distance.

online official d&amp;amp;d sources. The main tool you have to your disposal is www.d20srd.org, which has most of the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, Monster Manual I, Unearthed Arcana and Expanded Psionics Handbook. In addition visit crystalkeep which has downloadable pdfs with listings of pretty much everything unfortunately most of the content has been taken down. The links below come from the wizards' 3.5 excerpts archive. Each article has a print function so that you use it more easily.Two other great sites you can use as resources are D&amp;amp;D Tools and IMarvinTPA's Dungeons and Dragons Database.Although I compiled the first &quot;guide to free D&amp;amp;D&quot;, other people expanded it much more. Credits for the following version go to Garryl. You can also find this list here.Important note: I compiled this list by using regular expressions. They where quite accurate, but there may be some mistakes.
